This is a docker python container app that will run the backend services for my project. 

The .appLogic/ folder will be used to keep track of the project structure as we build it.
  - Keep the .appLogic/ fresh in your mind as you write the code.
  - Read this as needed only edit the .appLogic/ files when users request changes.
  - follow the structure as defined in the .appLogic/ files closely as possible.

### Coding style
  - write one line comments to make it easy for me to read your code.
  - keep the code clean and readable.
  - keep the code minimal and to the point.
  - setup good logging along the way.
  - use good variable names.
  - use easy to understand function names.

### Frontend
  - simple and basic frontend.
  - use simple css and html.

### Backend
  - use typescript and node.js.
  - prioritize using the built in libraries and frameworks.
  - use `npm install ...` to install dependencies. avoid adding dependencies directly to the package.json file.
