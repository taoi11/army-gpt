This is a docker python container app that will run the backend services for my project. 

The /.appLogic folder will be used to keep track of the project structure as we build it.
  - Keep the /.appLogic fresh in your mind as you write the code.
  - Read this as needed only edit the /.appLogic files when users request changes.
  - follow the structure as defined in the /.appLogic files closely as possible.

Coding style:
  - write one line comments to make it easy for me to read your code.
  - keep the code clean and readable.
  - keep the code minimal and to the point.
  - setup good logging along the way.
  - use good variable names.
  - use easy to understand function names.

When writing code be thorough and cover all functions interacting with the changes you are making.
