1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 1997-11-28

**Date of Last Modification:** 2017-01-20

**Application:** This Defence Administrative Order and Directive (DAOD) is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authorities:**

*   Deputy Minister of National Defence (DM)
*   Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)

**Enquiries:** Director Strategic Corporate Services (DSCS)

2\. Defence Administrative Orders and Directives
------------------------------------------------

**General**

**2.1** To enable the Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) to effectively carry out their complementary roles, it is essential that appropriate instruments be chosen to permit the communication of clear and concise direction and guidance to DND employees and CAF members. DAOD 1000-2, _Communicating Direction in the DND and the CF_, provides information on the types of instruments to use in communicating direction and guidance in the DND and the CAF. Among the instruments that can be used are DAODs.

**Criteria**

**2.2** A DAOD is normally the instrument of choice by which a level one (L1) advisor or other senior official may communicate direction if all the following criteria are met:

1.  the L1 advisor or other senior official has been assigned functional authority to develop and issue the DAOD by a policy framework DAOD;
2.  the direction is permanent;
3.  the direction is not of a local, specialized, technical or detailed nature;
4.  the DAOD applies to DND employees or CAF members, or both, in at least two commands or National Defence Headquarters groups;
5.  the DAOD does not direct the conduct of CAF operations (operations are conducted by assigned missions and tasks); and
6.  the DAOD does not duplicate policies and directives of central agencies.

**Note –** Compensation and Benefits Instructions for the Canadian Forces, not DAODs, are issued to set out pay, allowances and other financial benefits for CAF members.

**Policy and Instructional DAODs**

**2.3** There are two types of DAODs:

1.  policy DAODs; and
2.  instructional DAODs.

**2.4** A policy DAOD explains the overarching DND and CAF position on a specific topic, establishes the bounds within which an organization will operate, clearly articulates the goals to be attained, and provides guidance for related management decisions and actions. Information on how a policy will be implemented is found in associated instructional DAODs.

**2.5** The purpose of an instructional DAOD is to set out the directives and orders necessary to attain the DND and CAF policy direction in a policy DAOD. The policy direction and anticipated results in a policy DAOD require that specific procedures be implemented in order to ensure that those policy directions are met. In simple terms, an instructional DAOD sets out how a policy is implemented. Instructional DAODs are normally not stand-alone documents, and are generally made within the policy boundaries set by a “parent” policy DAOD.

3\. Development Process
-----------------------

**General**

**3.1** The development of a DAOD involves either the:

1.  creation of new information;
2.  modification of an existing DAOD; or
3.  conversion of information in existing policies, directives, orders or other instruments to a DAOD.

**Completion Time**

**3.2** The actual completion time for each stage of the DAOD development process will depend on the complexity and length of the DAOD and the other priorities of those involved in the development process.

**Stages of Development**

**3.3** The development of a DAOD follows a process that consists of the following five stages:

1.  initiation;
2.  drafting;
3.  review;
4.  approval; and
5.  promulgation.

**Assistance in Developing DAODs**

**3.4** DSCS 3, Corporate Management Policies, should be contacted for a more detailed description of the development of a DAOD at any stage of the process.

**_DAOD Development Guide_**

**3.5** Detailed guidance on the content and preparation of policy and instructional DAODs is set out in the _DAOD Development Guide_. DAOD developers are expected to follow the guide and not deviate from it without good justification.

4\. Consequences
----------------

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**4.1** Each DAOD may have a paragraph, reviewed by a subject-matter legal advisor (SMLA), which outlines the specific consequences of non-compliance with the DAOD.

**4.2** As DAODs are a means of ensuring oversight across the DND and the CAF, non-compliance with this DAOD or any other DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
