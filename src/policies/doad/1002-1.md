(_Policy on Privacy Protection_, Treasury Board)

3\. Objectives and Expected Results
-----------------------------------

**Objectives**

**3.1** The objectives of this DAOD are to establish consistent practices and procedures for the processing of requests for:

1.  access to personal information that is under the control of the DND and the CAF; and
2.  correction of personal information that is under the control of the DND and the CAF and has been used, is used or is available for use for an administrative purpose.

**Expected Results**

**3.2** It is expected that by following the instructions in this DAOD there will be:

1.  effective, well–coordinated and proactive administration of the Privacy Act within the DND and the CAF;
2.  complete, accurate and timely responses provided to any individual who exercises their right under the Privacy Act of access to and correction of their personal information; and
3.  efficient processes developed that will permit the disclosure of personal information by DND and the CAF organizations, if possible, directly to the individual to whom it relates, without a formal request under the Privacy Act.

4. Overview
-----------

**Right of Access**

**4.1** Section 12 of the _Privacy Act_ provides an individual with a legal right to be given access to their personal information contained in a personal information bank (PIB) and any other personal information held by the DND and the CAF with respect to which the individual is able to provide sufficiently specific information to locate the information. Any individual who has been given access to personal information that has been used, is being used or is available for use for an administrative purpose is entitled to request correction of that information if the individual believes it is not accurate.

**4.2** Section 13 of the _Privacy Act_ requires that an individual submit a request in writing to the government institution that is in control of the records containing their personal information. Formal requests made under the _Privacy Act_ for personal information must be processed by DAIP.

**Accessing Personal Information Informally**

**4.3** Despite an individual’s legal right under the _Privacy Act_ to be given access to their personal information, the principle of openness and transparency should be promoted wherever possible by providing an individual with direct access to their personal information. The appropriate release authority within DND and CAF organizations may authorize the release of personal information directly to the individual to whom the personal information relates. All information released in this manner must comply with the _National Defence Security Orders and Directives_, Chapter 6, _Security of Information_, and the associated _Security of Information Standards_, which takes into account applicable exemptions or exclusions under the _Privacy Act_. A formal request under the _Privacy Act_, processed by DAIP, is not required in such cases.

5\. Privacy Act Request Processing
----------------------------------

**5.1** All formal requests under the Privacy Act for access to personal information must be addressed to the DAIP for processing. Formal requests are those requests submitted in writing to the DND and the CAF in accordance with section 13 of the _Privacy Act_.

**5.2** During the processing of a tasking from DAIP to provide records in response to a personal information request, the office of primary interest (OPI) and other DND employees and CAF members must consider limiting, on a need-to-know basis, the disclosure of information that could directly or indirectly lead to the identification of a requester, unless the requester otherwise consents.

**5.3** DND employees and CAF members must follow the _Instruction on Personal Information Requests_ _and Personal Information Correction_ when processing DAIP taskings for personal information requests. DND and CAF OPIs may have their own internal procedures for dealing with personal information requests but such procedures cannot restrict those set by DAIP as the responsible organization in the DND and the CAF for processing requests under the Privacy Act for access to personal information.

**Time Limits**

**5.4** All formal requests under the _Privacy Act_ for access to personal information must be processed within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request. Should a request for access to personal information take more than 30 days to process, the time limit may be extended by DAIP for an additional 30 days in accordance with section 15 of the _Privacy Act_. The requester must be provided a written explanation as to the reason for the delay.

**Reporting**

**5.5** DAIP is responsible for:

1.  preparing the annual report to Parliament on the administration of the _Privacy Act_;
2.  updating the DND and CAF _Info Source_ chapter; and
3.  providing a statistical report on the administration of the _Privacy Act_ to the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS).

**Note** _**–**_ See DAOD 1002-3, _Management of Personal Information_, for additional information regarding _Info Source_.

6. Correction of Personal Information Processing
------------------------------------------------

**6.1** If an individual who is given access by a formal request under the _Privacy Act_ to their personal information believes there is an error or omission in the personal information that has been used, is being used or is available for use for an administrative purpose, the individual may complete and forward a _Record Correction Request Form_ to DAIP in respect of each PIB containing the information. The _Record Correction Request Form_ is available on the TBS website.

**6.2** DND employees and CAF members must follow the _Instruction on Personal Information Requests and Personal Information Correction_ when processing DAIP taskings for the correction of personal information. DND and CAF OPIs may have their own internal procedures for dealing with corrections but such procedures cannot restrict those set by DAIP as the responsible organization in the DND and the CAF for processing requests under the _Privacy Act_ for the correction of personal information.

7\. Privacy Act Training and Awareness
--------------------------------------

**Appropriate Training**

**7.1** Level one advisors (L1s) must ensure that all DND employees and CAF members responsible for personal information management receive appropriate training.

**Contracts, Arrangements and Other Agreements**

**7.2** As access by an individual to their personal information is a statutory right under the _Privacy Act_, L1s must ensure that all DND employees and CAF members who develop contracts, arrangements or other agreements do not purport by the use of restrictive clauses to limit that right.

8\. Office of the Privacy Commissioner
--------------------------------------

**8.1** A requester must be notified of their right to complain to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) if access to a record or part of a record is refused.

**8.2** DND and CAF OPIs must cooperate with DAIP in providing representations to the OPC.

9\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

**Compliance**

**9.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with the Privacy Act, the _Privacy Regulations_ and this DAOD. Should clarification of these laws, policies or instructions be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_ and this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**9.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_ or this DAOD. Non-compliance may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**9.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect to the compliance of DND employees, see the _Treasury Board Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
