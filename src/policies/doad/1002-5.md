3\. Objective and Expected Results
----------------------------------

### Objectives

**3.1** The objectives of this DAOD are to:

1.  provide direction to DND employees and CAF members with respect to the administration of privacy impact assessments (PIAs) for a new program or activity involving the creation, collection or handling of personal information, or the making of any substantial modification to an existing program or activity; and
2.  ensure, through the conduct of PIAs, sound management and decision making as well as careful consideration of privacy risks with respect to the creation, collection and handling of personal information as part of a program or activity.

### Expected Results

**3.2** It is expected that by following the instructions in this DAOD that:

1.  PIAs will be conducted in a manner that is commensurate with the level of privacy risk identified prior to establishing any new program or activity involving the creation, collection or handling of personal information, or the making of any substantial modification to an existing program or activity; and
2.  privacy implications will be appropriately identified, assessed and resolved prior to implementing any new program or activity, or the making of any substantial modification to an existing program or activity.

4\. Overview
------------

### Context

**4.1** The _Privacy Act_ and the _Privacy Regulations_ provide the legal framework for the creation, collection, accuracy, correction, use, disclosure, retention and disposition of personal information required by a government institution in the administration of a program or activity.

**4.2** The DND and the CAF must ensure that privacy protection is a core consideration when any new program or activity is developed, or if any substantial modification is made to any existing program or activity. Sound management and decision making, as well as careful consideration of privacy risks with respect to the creation, collection and handling of personal information, must be integrated into any program or activity of the DND and the CAF.

**4.3** The DND and the CAF routinely perform broad risk management activities and develop risk profiles for a program or activity. The PIA is the component of risk management that focuses on ensuring compliance with the requirements of the _Privacy Act_ and assessing the privacy implications of a program or activity.

**4.4** A PIA may also be used to evaluate any planned legislative, regulatory, policy or program initiative that could relate to the _Privacy Act_ or have an impact on the privacy of individuals.

**4.5** When a PIA is properly framed and integrated within the broader risk management framework, the completion of a PIA should not be a resource-intensive exercise. As such, a PIA is conducted in a manner that is commensurate with the privacy risk identified, respects the operating environment, and leverages other existing risk management tools.

**4.6** For the purpose of the Treasury Board (TB) _Policy on Privacy Protection_ and the _Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment_, the Corp Sec has issued this DAOD and the _Privacy Impact Assessment Toolkit_ to provide direction and guidance to the DND and the CAF on the effective administration of PIAs. A PIA must be developed and maintained in accordance with the _Privacy Impact Assessment Toolkit_.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1002/1002-5-privacy-impact-assessments.html#wb-tphp)

5\. Privacy Impact Assessment Process
-------------------------------------

### PIA Initiation

**5.1** Level one advisors (L1s) are accountable for ensuring that privacy risks are properly assessed and, if possible, mitigated for any program or activity within their organizations. The initial undertaking and ongoing updating of a PIA is essential in order to document the privacy risks and proposed mitigations of any new, ongoing or modified program or activity if there is potential impact to the personal information under the control of the DND and the CAF.

**5.2** Upon the initiation of a new or modified program or activity, the program lead for the program or activity should contact DAIP to assist with the determination as to whether there is a potential impact on the privacy of individuals. If there is potential impact, a PIA must be developed. The PIA balances privacy with other legislative, regulatory, policy, program and activity requirements.

**Note  ̶**  The program lead is the official holding administrative responsibility for the completion of a PIA. If an official is not specifically assigned, this responsibility will rest with the senior official or executive holding functional responsibility for the program or activity in question.

**5.3** The program lead must initiate a PIA for any program or activity under the control of their organization in the following circumstances:

*   personal information is used for or is intended to be used as part of a decision-making process that directly affects individuals;
*   any substantial modification is being made to an existing program or activity in which personal information is used or intended to be used for an administrative purpose;
*   the contracting out or transfer of a program or activity to another level of government, a private sector entity or an individual results in any substantial modification to the program or activity; or
*   decisions that directly affect individuals are not being made but there will be an impact on privacy that warrants the conduct of a PIA (see paragraph 5.5 for additional information).

### Personal Information Bank (PIB)

**5.4** A PIB must exist prior to the collection of personal information. The _Privacy Act_ requires government institutions to identify, describe and publicly report collections of personal information. It is necessary to complete a PIA in order to establish a PIB. See DAOD 1002-3, _Personal Information Management_, for additional information.

### Use of a Privacy Protocol

**5.5** If any new program or activity or any substantial modification to an existing program or activity does not use or intend to use personal information as part of a decision-making process that directly affects individuals, the program lead must still determine, in consultation with DAIP, if there is any impact on privacy that would warrant the conduct of an assessment. In some circumstances a privacy protocol may be adequate to address the potential impact on privacy by such a program or activity.

**5.6** The program lead must ensure that the decision to rely on a privacy protocol and not complete a PIA is documented.

**5.7** All personal information collected by the DND and the CAF that is not related to a decision-making process that directly affects an individual must be collected in accordance with a privacy protocol for a non-administrative purpose. See the _Instruction on Privacy Protocols for Non-Administrative Purpose_ for additional information.

### PIA Development

**5.8** During the development of the PIA, the program lead must:

*   evaluate whether:
    *   the program or activity is necessary to achieve a specific and legitimate purpose;
    *   the program or activity is likely to be effective in achieving the legitimate purpose;
    *   the intrusion of privacy is proportional to the benefit to be derived; and
    *   there is no other alternative that is less intrusive to the privacy of individuals that would achieve the same purpose; and
*   seek the review and recommendations of DAIP privacy analysts, legal advisors and other applicable technical and information specialists.

**5.9** DAIP privacy analysts must provide advice and recommendations with respect to relevant program statutes, the _Privacy Act_, the _Access to Information Act_, privacy issues, current privacy developments, and national and international privacy standards. The program lead develops or modifies the PIB description in consultation with DAIP.

**5.10** The program lead must seek legal review as to the legal authority to conduct any new program or activity or make any substantial modification to an existing program or activity, including legal review of any potential issues that may have been raised with respect to the _Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms_.

**5.11** The program lead must seek the review and recommendations of:

*   technical specialists to provide technical and systems advice on legacy systems, Internet tools, system interfaces, security, data flows and technical architecture; and
*   information specialists to provide advice on how records for the new program or activity will be kept and their retention requirements.

**5.12** The program lead must ensure that:

*   the PIA is completed in accordance with the _Privacy Impact Assessment Toolkit_;
*   a determination is made as to the appropriate format for the PIA, based on the DND and the CAF business needs, internal reporting and broader risk management activities;
*   the PIA includes a risk level that is based on the DND and the CAF business needs, internal reporting and broader risk management activities; and
*   additional documentation and analysis, including mitigation plans and strategies, are provided in consultation with DAIP if further elaboration on specific risk mitigation is warranted.

### Approval

**5.13** The signature of the responsible program lead as well as that of the L1 are required for a completed PIA to be approved.

**5.14** The L1 must provide the approved PIA to DAIP.

**5.15** DAIP must ensure that the approved PIA is provided to the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), along with the proposed PIB description for any new program or activity, or modified PIB description for any substantial modification to an existing program or activity, unless otherwise specified in the terms and conditions of a delegation made under subsection 71(6) of the _Privacy Act_. The TBS confirms that mandatory requirements of the core PIA have been completed for the purpose of establishing or modifying a PIB.

**5.16** DAIP must also simultaneously send the approved PIA to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). The OPC undertakes a comprehensive review of the PIA and all associated documents and will offer advice, comments, consultation and recommendation.

**5.17** Once approved, a PIA will require routine updating and maintenance to reflect any changes to delivery of the program or activity.

6\. Public Reporting and Monitoring
-----------------------------------

### Public Reporting

**6.1** In accordance with the _Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment_, the following sections of a core PIA, once approved, must be made available to the public:

*   overview and PIA initiation; and
*   risk area identification and categorization.

**6.2** While respecting security requirements as well as any other confidentiality or legal consideration, DAIP is responsible for making sections of the core PIA available to the public.

### Monitoring

**6.3** DAIP is responsible for monitoring compliance with this DAOD as it relates to the administration of the _Privacy Act_.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1002/1002-5-privacy-impact-assessments.html#wb-tphp)

7\. Multi-Institutional Privacy Impact Assessments
--------------------------------------------------

**7.1** A multi-institutional PIA involves more than one government institution. A lead government institution must be identified in any multi-institutional PIA. Unless otherwise established by a contract or arrangement, the lead government institution will be the government institution that has primary control over the personal information or holds the authority for initiating the program or activity.

**7.2** If the lead government institution cannot be identified under paragraph 7.1 because the program or activity is common to all government institutions, the lead will be, unless otherwise established by a contract or arrangement, the government institution that either:

*   is responsible for delivering the program or activity across government;
*   is the contracting authority for the program or activity; or
*   is the policy authority for the program or activity across government.

**7.3** A multi-institutional PIA requires the coordination of an interdepartmental committee comprised of key stakeholders, including policy and legal advisors.

**7.4** In the case of a joint program or activity, a multi-institutional PIA is favored. The most appropriate approach for the completion and approval of the multi-institutional PIA in support of the program or activity must be determined and documented. At a minimum, the approach must take into consideration the approval process of the government institutions involved and will cover the full scope of the program or activity.

**7.5** There must be oversight of the collection of personal information as well as any disclosures to government institutions involved in the program or activity.

**7.6** Approval of a multi-institutional PIA by all appropriate stakeholders must be obtained.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1002/1002-5-privacy-impact-assessments.html#wb-tphp)

8\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

### Compliance

**8.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_, this DAOD and the _Privacy Impact Assessment Toolkit_. Should clarification of these laws, policies or instructions be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_, this DAOD and the _Privacy Impact Assessment Toolkit_.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**8.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_, this DAOD or the _Privacy Impact Assessment Toolkit_. Non-compliance may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**8.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members. 

**Note –** In respect to the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
