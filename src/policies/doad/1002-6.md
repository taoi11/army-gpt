(i) the name of the individual where it appears with other personal information relating to the individual or where the disclosure of the name itself would reveal information about the individual,

but, for the purposes of sections 7, 8 and 26 and section 19 of the Access to Information Act, does not include

(j) information about an individual who is or was an officer or employee of a government institution that relates to the position or functions of the individual including,

3. Application, Objective and Expected Results
----------------------------------------------

4\. General Provisions
----------------------

**4.1** Personal information under the control of the DND and the CAF must not be disclosed except in accordance with section 8 of the _Privacy Act_, which provides that:

1.  personal information may be disclosed with consent;
2.  personal information may be disclosed without consent but only for the purposes described in subsection 8(2); and
3.  statutory prohibitions against disclosure specified in other Acts of Parliament take precedence over permissible disclosures under the _Privacy Act_.

**4.2** Administrative controls must be in place to ensure that personal information is not disclosed inappropriately or without authorization. See DAOD 1002-3, _Personal Information Management_, for additional information.

### Exclusions from the Application of the _Privacy Act_

**4.3** Pursuant to subsection 69(2) of the _Privacy Act_, a government institution is not restricted from using or disclosing personal information that is publicly available. If publicly available personal information has been legitimately collected by the DND and the CAF, the disclosure provisions described in section 8 of the _Privacy Act_ do not apply to restrict the disclosure of such information.

**4.4** Personal information that constitutes a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada (a Cabinet confidence) is excluded from the application of the Privacy Act. The use and disclosure of such information is restricted to “authorized individuals” within the DND and the CAF. For additional information on “authorized individuals” and security measures required to protect Cabinet confidences from unauthorized disclosure or other forms of compromise, see the Privy Council Office _Policy on the Security of Cabinet Confidences_.

### Exceptions to the "Personal Information" Definition

**4.5** Paragraphs (j) to (m) of the "personal information" definition set out information that is not personal information for purposes of disclosure under section 8 of the _Privacy Act_. The "personal information" definition is set out in section 2 of this DAOD.

5\. Disclosures of Personal Information with Consent
----------------------------------------------------

**5.1** Consent is not required for the disclosure of personal information for the purpose for which the information was obtained or compiled, for a use consistent with that original purpose or for a purpose described in subsection 8(2) of _Privacy Act_.

**5.2** Consent must be obtained from the individual to whom the personal information relates for all other disclosures.

**5.3** When seeking consent for disclosure, consent must be obtained in writing and include sufficient information concerning the intended disclosure to allow the individual to make an informed decision on consent. See the _Instruction on Personal Information Management_ for additional information.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1002/1002-6-disclosure-of-personal-information.html#wb-tphp)

6\. Disclosures of Personal Information Without Consent – Subsection 8(2) of the _Privacy Act_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**6.1** Subsection 8(2) of the _Privacy Act_ sets out circumstances in which personal information under the control of the DND and the CAF may be disclosed without the consent of the individual. Subsection 8(2) applies only if no other statutory provision in any other Act of Parliament restricts the disclosure of the personal information.

**6.2** Disclosures under subsection 8(2) are discretionary and do not constitute a right of access.

**6.3** An individual’s general right to protection of privacy must be recognized when considering the discretion to disclose personal information. Additional criteria for consideration in the exercise of discretion are described in the _Instruction on Disclosure of Personal Information_.

**6.4** Only the minimal amount of personal information required to fulfill the specific purpose may be disclosed.

**6.5** If a permissible disclosure is not described in the relevant personal information bank (PIB), a record of disclosure must be retained so that it forms part of the individual’s personal information. This requirement does not apply to information disclosed under paragraph 8(2)(e) of the _Privacy Act_. See paragraphs 6.13 to 6.18 and section 8, _Records of Disclosure_, for additional information.

### Disclosure for an Original Purpose or Consistent Use

**6.6** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(a) of the Privacy Act to disclose personal information if it is necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the information was originally obtained or compiled, or for a consistent use. For a disclosure to be for a consistent use, it must have a reasonable and direct connection to the original purpose.

**6.7** Consistent uses must be described in the applicable PIB.

**6.8** New consistent uses which are not described in the PIB must be referred to DAIP. DAIP must notify the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) and update the PIB in the _Info Source – Sources of Federal Government and Employee Information_ to include the new consistent use.

### Disclosure in Accordance with an Act of Parliament or Regulation

**6.9** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(b) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information for any purpose in accordance with any Act of Parliament or any regulation made thereunder that authorizes its disclosure. This paragraph encompasses all authorities for the disclosure of personal information contained in federal statutes and regulations.

### Disclosure for Compliance with a Subpoena, Warrant, Court Order or Rules of Court

**6.10** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(c) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information for the purpose of complying with a subpoena or warrant issued or order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or for the purpose of complying with rules of court relating to the production of information. This includes federal quasi-judicial bodies and commissions of inquiry.

**6.11** Legal services should be consulted prior to any disclosure to ensure the validity of the order and determine the proper form of compliance.

### Disclosure to the Attorney General of Canada

**6.12** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(d) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to the Attorney General of Canada for use in legal proceedings involving the Crown in right of Canada (the Crown) or the Government of Canada.

### Disclosure to a Federal Investigative Body

**6.13** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(e) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to an investigative body specified in the regulations made under the _Privacy Act_, on the written request of the body, for the purpose of enforcing any law of Canada, a province or territory, or carrying out a lawful investigation, if the request specifies the purpose and describes the information to be disclosed.

**6.14** All disclosures pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(e) must be referred to DAIP as the delegate to authorize the release of the personal information. Requests must be made in writing, specify the purpose for which the information is required and describe the information to be disclosed.

**6.15** For purposes of paragraph 8(2)(e), there are the following three DND and CAF investigative bodies that may request personal information:

*   Boards of inquiry;
*   Canadian Forces Military Police; and
*   Canadian Forces National Counter-Intelligence Unit.

**6.16** Requests for, and records of disclosures, pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(e) are managed in accordance with the standard PIB PSU 913, _Disclosures to Investigative Bodies_.

**6.17** For reporting purposes, DAIP must retain:

1.  a copy of each request received; and
2.  a record of information disclosed pursuant to such a request.

**6.18** DAIP must make these copies available to the OPC, as required.

**Disclosure to a Province, Territory, Specific First Nation Councils, Foreign State or International Body for Administering or Enforcing any Law or Carrying Out a Lawful Investigation**

**6.19** For the purpose of administering or enforcing any law or carrying out a lawful investigation, the DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(f) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information under an agreement or arrangement between the Government of Canada or an institution thereof with:

1.  the government of a province or territory;
2.  certain First Nation councils as identified in paragraph 8(2)(f);
3.  the government of a foreign state;
4.  an international organization of states or an international organization established by the governments of states; or
5.  any institution of any such government or organization.

**6.20** Disclosures under paragraph 8(2)(f) must only be made in accordance with a formal written agreement or arrangement. Written agreements for the disclosure of personal information under paragraph 8(2)(f) have been made between the Government of Canada and the governments of the provinces, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.

### Disclosure to a Member of Parliament

**6.21** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(g) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to a member of Parliament for the purpose of assisting an individual to whom the information relates with resolving a problem. The term “member of Parliament” includes members of the House of Commons and the Senate.

**6.22** If Parliament has been dissolved prior to an election or a member of Parliament has resigned, this provision may not be applied until a new member of Parliament is sworn in.

### Disclosure for Audit Purposes

**6.23** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(h) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to DND employees and CAF members for internal audit purposes, or to the Office of the Comptroller General or any other person or body specified in regulations made under the _Privacy Act_ for audit purposes.

**6.24** Disclosures to the Office of the Auditor General of Canada are specifically authorized pursuant to the _Auditor General Act_ and are therefore permitted in accordance with paragraph 8(2)(b) of the _Privacy Act_.

### Disclosure for Archival Purposes

**6.25** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(i) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to Library and Archives Canada (LAC) for archival purposes. Archival purposes include the transfer of personal information to LAC control, as well as LAC examination of personal information in government records to determine archival value and establish retention and disposal standards.

### Disclosure for Research or Statistical Purposes

**6.26** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(j) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to any person or body for research or statistical purposes.

**6.27** All disclosures pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(j) must be referred to DAIP as the delegate to authorize the disclosure of personal information. For personal information to be disclosed under this provision, DAIP must be:

1.  satisfied that the purpose for which the information is disclosed cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the information is provided in a form that would identify the individual to whom it relates; and
2.  provided with a written undertaking from the person or body that no subsequent disclosure of the information will be made in a form that could reasonably be expected to identify the individual to whom it relates.

### Disclosure for First Nation Claims Research

**6.28** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(k) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to any Aboriginal government, association of Aboriginal people, Indian band, government institution or part thereof, or to any person acting on their behalf, for the purpose of researching or validating the claims, disputes or grievances of any of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.

### Disclosure for Payment of a Benefit or Collection of a Debt

**6.29** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(l) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information to any government institution for the purpose of locating an individual in order to collect a debt owing to the Crown by that individual or making a payment owing to an individual by the Crown.

**6.30** This provision does not permit the disclosure of information to determine whether a debt is owed, nor does it permit disclosure of any more information than is necessary to locate the individual.

### Disclosure in the Public Interest

**6.31** The DND and the CAF are permitted by paragraph 8(2)(m) of the _Privacy Act_ to disclose personal information for any purpose if:

1.  the public interest in disclosure clearly outweighs any invasion of privacy that could result from the disclosure; or
2.  disclosure would clearly benefit the individual to whom the information relates.

**6.32** All disclosures pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(m) must be referred to DAIP as the delegate to authorize the release of the personal information. DAIP must ensure that there is a clear public interest in the disclosure and that no other paragraph under subsection 8(2) applies.

**6.33** Disclosure decisions must balance the public interest in disclosure against the threat to an individual’s privacy based on:

1.  the expectations of the individual;
2.  the sensitivity or nature of the personal information involved; and
3.  the probability of injury or consequence of disclosure for the individual.

7\. Routine Disclosures of Personal Information
-----------------------------------------------

**7.1** When personal information is to be disclosed by the DND and the CAF to an international, federal, provincial, territorial or municipal public sector organization, an information sharing agreement or arrangement that includes appropriate privacy protection clauses must be established.

**7.2** When contracting with a private sector organization or individual, the DND and the CAF must ensure that appropriate privacy protection clauses are included in the contract or agreement.

**7.3** Routine disclosures of personal information that are not for the purpose for which the information was obtained or compiled, or for a consistent use, such as regular disclosures pursuant to subsection 8(2) of the _Privacy Act_, may be included in the relevant PIB description. See DAOD 1002-3 for additional information.

**7.4** If such routine disclosures of personal information are not described in the relevant PIB, each disclosure must be recorded on the individual’s file. See section 8, _Records of Disclosure_, for additional information.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1002/1002-6-disclosure-of-personal-information.html#wb-tphp)

8\. Records of Disclosure
-------------------------

**8.1** All disclosures of personal information must be accounted for in order to allow individuals to determine what specific disclosures of their personal information may occur or may have occurred.

**8.2** Disclosures must either be described in the applicable PIB or documented in a record of disclosure as required under subsection 9(1) of the _Privacy Act_.

**8.3** A record of disclosure must be prepared when personal information is disclosed for any purpose that is not described in a PIB. The record of disclosure must be attached to the individual’s personal information and is deemed to form part of the personal information to which it is attached. This record must be retained for a minimum of two years following the disclosure.

**8.4** If the purpose for disclosure is a consistent purpose not described in the PIB, see paragraph 6.8 for additional requirements.

**8.5** If personal information is disclosed to a federal investigative body under paragraph 8(2)(e) of the _Privacy Act_, see paragraph 6.17 for additional requirements.

**8.6** A record of disclosure must contain:

1.  the purpose for the disclosure;
2.  the name and title of the official who authorized the disclosure;
3.  the date of the disclosure;
4.  the name, title and institution or organization of the official receiving the personal information; and
5.  a copy of the personal information disclosed or a description in sufficient detail to allow a determination of exactly what personal information was disclosed.

**8.7** All records of disclosure must follow existing program record-keeping requirements for personal information disclosed for a purpose described in a PIB or with consent.

9. Privacy Training and Awareness
---------------------------------

### Appropriate Training

**9.1** DAIP is responsible for ensuring that training and tools pertaining to the disclosure of personal information are available to DND employees and CAF members.

**9.2** Level one advisors (L1s) must ensure that all DND employees and CAF members within their organizations who are responsible for the disclosure of personal information receive appropriate training.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1002/1002-6-disclosure-of-personal-information.html#wb-tphp)

10\. Compliance and Consequences
--------------------------------

### Compliance

**10.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_, this DAOD and the _Instruction on Disclosure of Personal Information_. Should clarification of these laws, policies or instructions be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_, this DAOD and the _Instruction on Disclosure of Personal Information_.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**10.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the _Privacy Act_, the _Privacy Regulations_, this DAOD or the _Instruction on Disclosure of Personal Information_. Non-compliance may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**10.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
