2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** Parking policies and instructions in the DAOD 1004 series reflect the government's core values of accountability and equity, and support other commitments, including responsible financial management, streamlined operations and sustainable practices. The policies and instructions also promote the coherent application of the principles supporting the administration of parking in the distinct operating environment at each defence establishment in Canada.

### Policy Statement

**2.3** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  acquiring and administering parking in accordance with the principles of responsible financial management of programmes and the sound stewardship of real property and immovables; and
2.  ensuring parking-related benefits are administered in accordance with applicable income tax law.

### Requirements

**2.4** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  administer parking at defence establishments in Canada in a fair and equitable manner, taking into consideration the distinct operating environment at each defence establishment;
2.  administer parking revenues in accordance with _Financial Administration Manual_ (FAM) Chapter 1018-1, _Managing Public Revenue_; and
3.  record and report taxable benefits related to parking in accordance with applicable income tax law.

**2.5** The DSISSS must notify the VCDS of any non-compliance with this DAOD.

3\. Consequences

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**3.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, as well as for DND employees and CAF members as individuals.

Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  a negative employer compliance audit from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA);
2.  a reassessment of past individual tax returns by CRA for all workers who may have had access to a particular parking facility;
3.  the withdrawal of the privilege of parking on a defence establishment;
4.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions; and
5.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both.
