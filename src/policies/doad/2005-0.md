1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2017-09-28

**Enquiries:** Director of General Safety (D Safe G)

The obligation of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces to adopt measures to eliminate disadvantage to current and prospective Department of National Defence employees, Canadian Armed Forces members and applicants to the Canadian Armed Forces, as a result of a rule, policy, practice or barrier that has or may have an adverse impact on individuals or designated groups protected under the _Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,_ the _Canadian Human Rights Act_ or the _Employment Equity Act_.

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**3.1** The Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) have a duty to accommodate the employment-related needs of DND employees and the service-related needs of CAF members with disabilities up to the point of undue hardship. Accommodation must respect individual dignity to enable individuals to carry out their work-related and service-related functions and activities. Service dogs provide support to people with a wide array of disabilities. From the Canadian Forces Health Services Group perspective, the use of service dogs is not a form of medical treatment, but it is recognized that a service dog may be beneficial to a person with a disability if used at the appropriate time under a treatment plan determined by a medical practitioner.

**Policy Statement**

**3.2** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  ensuring that individual consideration will be given to DND employees and CAF members with disabilities who request service dog access to defence establishments;
2.  providing appropriate direction for service dog access to defence establishments;
3.  determining the necessary documentation to verify the training and certification of a service dog team; and
4.  considering accommodation requests for access to defence establishments by service animals other than service dogs on a case-by-case basis and on similar terms as for service dogs.

**Requirements**

**3.3** The DND and the CAF must ensure that:

1.  any service dog being considered for access to a defence establishment is required for providing assistance to a person with a disability;
2.  each service dog team is certified in writing as having been trained by an accredited service dog training institution; and
3.  the health and safety of other persons at a defence establishment are not compromised by the presence of a service dog.

**Note –** Accreditation for service dog training institutions is provided by national and international organizations, including Assistance Dogs International, the International Guide Dog Federation, and Meghan Search and Rescue (MSAR).

**3.4** This DAOD must be read in conjunction with applicable federal laws, e.g. the _Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms_, the _Canadian Human Rights Act_ and the _Canada Labour Code_, Part II, and applicable DND and CAF policies, e.g. DAOD 5015-0, _Workplace Accommodation_.

4\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

**Compliance**

**4.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non Compliance**

**4.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non compliance with this DAOD may result in administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee, and administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member. Non compliance may also result in the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect to the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
