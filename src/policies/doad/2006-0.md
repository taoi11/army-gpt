2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**2.1** The Treasury Board _Policy on Government Security_ (PGS) outlines the requirements for security in the Government of Canada and its departments. The PGS provides that government security is the assurance that information, assets and services are protected against compromise. For the purposes of this DAOD, security is the condition achieved when DND employees, CAF members, information, assets, resources and services are protected against espionage, sabotage, subversion and terrorism, as well as against loss or unauthorized disclosure. For the purposes of the PGS, the Director General Defence Security (DGDS) has been appointed by the Deputy Minister (DM) and the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) as the Chief Security Officer (CSO).

**2.2** The extent to which the DND and the CAF can ensure their own security, in and outside of Canada, directly affects their ability to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians, and the maintenance of international peace and stability. The management of security requires the continuous assessment of risks as well as the implementation, monitoring and maintenance of appropriate internal security controls.

**2.3** Threats to the DND and the CAF may come from various sources in or outside of Canada. The threats may be overt, covert or clandestine in nature. They may be deliberate, inadvertent or some combination of both. Threats may involve criminality, espionage, insider activity, sabotage, subversion or terrorism. Additionally, negligence, indifference, a lack of security awareness or culture, a concentration of assets, operational and fiscal constraints, and ever-changing technology may also contribute to security vulnerabilities. In order to maintain operational effectiveness, vulnerabilities must be continuously examined and monitored in light of existing and emerging threats.

**2.4** Failure to provide adequately for security may result in the inability of the DND and the CAF to carry out essential missions and may have an effect on their engagement in numerous bilateral and multilateral security arrangements, including their involvement in shared programs, operations and activities, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and allied countries. Success in security can only be achieved through a common and collaborative approach, therefore support of security policies by senior managers and the chain of command at all levels is essential.

**2.5** Detailed security-related responsibilities for all DND employees and CAF members, including level one advisors and commanders of commands, are set out in applicable chapters of the _National Defence Security Orders and Directives_ (NDSOD). The DGDS division has been established as the organization responsible for security in the DND and the CAF, and for the issuance of the NDSOD.

**Note** – The NDSOD have replaced the:

*   _Security Orders_ _for the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces_;
*   _National Defence Security Policy_;
*   _National Defence Security Instructions_; and
*   _Defence Security Manual_.

**2.6** The Treasury Board _Standard on Security Screening_ provides that deputy heads are accountable for rendering decisions regarding security clearances and reliability statuses. While the DM retains the authority for decisions to deny, revoke or suspend a security clearance for DND employees, the CDS has delegated to the Vice Chief of Defence Staff (VCDS) the authority for decisions to deny, revoke or suspend a security clearance for CAF members.

**Policy Statement**

**2.7** The DND and the CAF are committed to strengthening and ensuring the security of DND employees, CAF members, information, assets, resources and services.

**Requirements**

**2.8** This DAOD should be read in conjunction with DAOD 1000-8, _Policy Framework for Safety and Security Management_, the NDSOD and applicable security-related Government of Canada policies, directives and standards, interdepartmental arrangements, and international agreements and arrangements.

**2.9** To implement this DAOD, the DND and the CAF must ensure that:

1.  a security governance structure is established, with the necessary mechanisms and resources to provide effective and integrated security risk management, which sets out clear authorities and responsibilities for security within the DND and the CAF;
2.  security is an integral component of planning and is embedded in DND and CAF frameworks, initiatives, projects, culture, day-to-day operations and leadership, and the behaviour of all DND employees and CAF members;
3.  the continuity of DND business, CAF operations and critical services is maintained in the presence of security events, disruptions and emergencies;
4.  the security roles and responsibilities of DND employees and CAF members are clearly delineated and understood;
5.  DND employees, CAF members, contractors and other persons working in DND and CAF facilities receive appropriate security briefings and training;
6.  all individuals who have access to DND and CAF information and assets have an appropriate security clearance or reliability status before their duties begin and are treated in a fair and unbiased manner during the screening process;
7.  functional security committees are established to provide additional oversight and forums for security risk management decisions;
8.  security events are appropriately reported and managed;
9.  interoperability and information exchanges are enabled through effective and consistent security measures and identity management practices; and
10.  security measures are adopted, amended and reflected in day-to-day operations in response to applicable security arrangements, partnerships and alliances.

3\. Consequences
----------------

**General**

3.1 Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians, and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
