3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** Together, the CAF and the DND is a unique Canadian institution. They bring together Canadians from all regions of the country and all ethnic backgrounds, through military and public service, in pursuit of the common mission of defending Canada and Canadian interests and values while contributing to international peace and security.

**3.2** In fulfilling this mission, the role of Public Affairs (PA) is to promote understanding and awareness among Canadians of the role, mandate and activities of the CAF and DND, and of the contributions that the CAF and DND make to Canadian society and the international community.

**3.3** Canadians expect and deserve to know what the men and women of the CAF and DND do on their behalf. Public support for the CAF and DND follows from public understanding of how the CF and DND make a difference at home and abroad. Public confidence, in turn, is enhanced by the ability of the CAF and DND to achieve its mandate in a manner that is open, transparent, and consistent with Canadian values and expectations.

**3.4** In short, public support and confidence follow from the ability of the CAF and DND to both deliver **_and_** inform.

**3.5** The intent of the PA policy is to ensure that Canadians are well-informed and aware of the role, mandate, operations and contributions of the CAF and DND. The policy is designed to establish and articulate PA operating principles, authorities, accountabilities, responsibilities, requirements and guidelines for CF members and DND employees at all levels to help them build, nurture and maintain a strong relationship with the public.

**3.6** The policy seeks to achieve these objectives by establishing a modern, progressive and professional approach to PA that actively encourages openness and transparency, integrates PA into CAF and DND operations at all levels, delegates authority and empowers CF members and DND employees to speak more openly to Canadians about what they do and how they make a difference to Canada and the international community.

### Policy Statement

**3.7** It is DND and CAF policy to:

1.  inform the public of its policies, programs, services, activities, operations and initiatives in a manner that is accurate, complete, objective, timely, relevant, understandable, and open and transparent within the law;
2.  take into account the views and concerns of the public when planning, developing and implementing policies, programs, services and operations;
3.  fully integrate PA into the decision-making process for policy development, program design, service delivery and military operations; and,
4.  coordinate PA planning and program delivery, including internal communications, within a planned, corporate framework based on a partnership among commanding officers (COs), DND managers and professional PA practitioners.

### Requirements

**3.8** The CAF and DND shall:

1.  embed the principles of openness, transparency and accessibility into the day-to-day operations of the CAF and DND, while respecting the constraints to openness imposed by legislation and regulation;
2.  embed into the CAF and DND chains of command responsibility for fully integrating PA, including internal communications, into the decision-making process for policy development, program design, service delivery, and military doctrine and operations;
3.  articulate and communicate accountability and responsibility for PA across all levels to ensure the PA roles and responsibilities of all CF members and DND employees are clearly defined and understood;
4.  establish procedures for the proactive management of issues and crises placing priority on identifying problems, promptly implementing solutions, and promptly informing the public in a complete and accurate manner of what the CAF and/or DND are doing to address the issues or problems and why;
5.  integrate PA operating principles and requirements into military doctrine, military planning, decision-making, and the achievement of CAF operations;
6.  incorporate PA components into pre-deployment training and major training programs for new recruits, officer candidates, leadership and management candidates;
7.  establish requirements, procedures and standards for advertising, audio-visual and multi-media production; corporate internal communications; PA research; publishing; Internet publishing; and, PA training and education to ensure that PA programs and activities are planned, resourced and executed in a manner that is cost-effective and consistent with modern PA practices and in accordance with federal identity standards; and
8.  review and update the PA policy and its related orders and directives every five years.

4\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Legislation, Regulation, and Policy

**4.1** DND employees and CF members at all levels must manage their PA programs and activities, as appropriate, in accordance with the principles and requirements of federal laws and policies, including the:

1.  _National Defence Act_;
2.  _Official Languages Act_;
3.  _Access to Information Act_;
4.  _Privacy Act_;
5.  _Copyright Act_;
6.  _Official Secrets Act_;
7.  _Canada Evidence Act_;
8.  _Financial Administration Act_;
9.  _Government Communications Policy_; and
10.  DND and CF Security Orders and Directives.

**4.2** CF members must also adhere to the principles and requirements of Queen's Regulations and Orders, including:

1.  QR&O 19.14, _Improper Comments_;
2.  QR&O 19.36, _Disclosure of Information or Opinion_; and
3.  QR&O 24.02, _Press Releases Regarding Casualties_.

### Openness, and Transparency

**4.3** CF members and DND employees face significant challenges in their efforts to inform the public and ensure the public's right to know, while being fully aware and respectful of legal restrictions on releasing detailed information about:

1.  individuals (restricted by the _Privacy Act_);
2.  sensitive elements of military operations (restricted by the _National Defence Act_ and the _Official Secrets Act_); and
3.  issues before the courts (which is restricted by the _Canada Evidence Act_ and the _Charter of Rights and Freedoms_).

**4.4** While these restrictions place legal limits on the ability of the CAF and DND to live up to demands for complete openness, every effort should be made to be as open and transparent as possible within the law.

**4.5** To this end, CF members and DND employees at all levels shall manage their programs and activities in a manner that:

1.  maximizes public and media accessibility to information regarding DND and CAF policies, programs, services, operations and initiatives in a timely manner and within the law;
2.  minimizes the need for the public or media to resort to the _Access to Information Act_ as a means of obtaining information from DND or the CAF; and
3.  conforms to both the letter and the spirit of the _Access to Information Act_.

### Accountability

**4.6** Regardless of rank or level, CF members and DND employees are accountable to their chain of command for the accuracy and currency of the information they make available to the public.

### Responsibility

**4.7** PA is a responsibility of the CAF and DND chain of command, and must be adequately resourced and fully integrated into the decision-making process for policy development, program design, service delivery, and military operations.

**4.8** To this end, Group Principals and Environmental Chiefs of Staff (ECS) shall:

1.  familiarize themselves with PA policies, orders, directives and strategic priorities; and
2.  ensure that the PA components of their programs, operations or activities are adequately resourced to support operations and/or policy, program and service delivery.

**4.9** Group Principals shall:

1.  ensure that their PA account managers are members of group or branch management committees; and
2.  provide their PA account managers access to the information required to participate effectively in decision-making and provide PA advice on the impacts of decisions taken.

**4.10** ECS shall:

1.  ensure that the most senior Public Affairs Officer (PAO) assigned to a command, area, division, wing, base or unit reports directly to their CO and is included in all key decision-making fora, committees, and/or work groups;
2.  provide their senior PAO access to the information required to participate effectively in decision-making and provide PA advice on the impact of decisions; and
3.  integrate the principles, requirements and objectives of the DND and CAF PA policy and its related orders into military doctrine.

### Flexible, but Corporate

**4.11** With support from public affairs officers or account managers, COs and DND managers shall ensure that the PA components of their programs, operations and/or activities reflect the needs of their intended audiences and:

*   advance the priorities of their Command or Group;
*   contribute to the achievement of CAF and DND priorities;
*   contribute to public understanding and awareness of the CAF and DND as a whole; and
*   are evaluated in accordance with CAF and DND performance measurement practices.

### Internal Communications

**4.12** Perhaps more than any other function, internal communications is a collective responsibility that cuts across all levels of the DND and the CAF.

**4.13** CF members and DND employees have a responsibility to keep their colleagues informed of how their activities impact on their unit, base or section. COs and DND managers, in turn, have a responsibility to inform CF members and DND employees of corporate policies, programs and services that have a broad impact on the CAF and DND.

**4.14** In this **corporate** context, internal communications is a vital element of PA. CF members and DND employees contribute to public understanding of what the CAF and DND do on behalf of Canadians. To communicate effectively with the public, however, CF members and DND employees must be well-informed.

**4.15** To this end, internal communications shall be a responsibility of the DND and CAF chain of command and shall be fully integrated into PA planning and program delivery.

**4.16** In fulfilling their responsibilities for internal communications, COs and DND managers shall:

1.  incorporate internal communications into their PA plans;
2.  ensure that the internal communications components of their programs, operations or activities are adequately resourced to achieve planned objectives; and
3.  include internal communications when implementing PA programs.

### Modern Values and Practices

**4.17** COs and DND managers shall ensure that:

1.  their PA materials and activities reflect modern Canadian values, including the elimination of sexual stereotyping and the fair, representative depiction of people in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity;
2.  a proportion of annual PA expenditures are directed toward PA materials for use by the blind or visually impaired and/or others who are unable to read print or use alternate media;
3.  they make information available to the public as clearly and concisely as possible, in both the form the public needs and the official language of its choice.

**4.18** COs and DND managers shall ensure that PA materials are made available:

1.  simultaneously, with equal prominence and linguistic quality, in English and French in accordance with DAOD 5039-0, _Official Languages_;
2.  simultaneously, in all regions of Canada, when they contain information of a national scope or nature (information of a regional or local scope or nature should be made available, as appropriate); and,
3.  in a manner responsive to Canada's multicultural character (this may involve producing PA materials in languages other than the official languages).

### Training

**4.19** COs and DND managers shall ensure that CF members and DND employees receive the training required to complete assigned tasks in accordance with PA policies, orders and directives.

### Federal and Corporate Identity

**4.20** All DND and CF PA materials shall meet the requirements of the Federal Identity Program and the requirements of the _DND and CF Corporate Communications Standards_ (to be developed).

### National Linkages

**4.21** DND and the CAF, like all federal departments, agencies and institutions, has a responsibility to support the overall efforts of the Government of Canada to explain the decisions of Parliament to the public.

**4.22** For this reason, all DND and CAF public affairs plans, materials and/or activities shall, as appropriate:

1.  take into account the over-arching priorities and objectives of the Government;
2.  take advantage of opportunities to explain to the public how DND and CAF initiatives support Government priorities and objectives, and/or how DND and CAF programs and activities relate to or support other government programs, such as foreign policy and international development assistance; and,
3.  take advantage of opportunities to work in partnership with other departments and agencies when communicating with the public in order to reduce duplication and costs.
