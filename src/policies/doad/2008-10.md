**Purpose**

**3.1** This DAOD establishes procedures for the areas of advertising, publishing and DND/CAF visual identity.

**3.2** The Government of Canada (GC), the DND and the CAF have specific requirements and standards in these areas, which must be met to achieve their objectives. The following higher-level policies identify ADM(PA) as the senior official who manages and coordinates activities in these areas and delivers expected policy results:

1.  in DAOD 1000-10, _Policy Framework for Corporate Administration Management_, the Deputy Minister (DM) and the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) have assigned functional authority to the ADM(PA) for advertising, visual identity, and electronic and print publishing of communications products; and
2.  under the Treasury Board _Directive on the Management of Communications_, ADM(PA), as head of communications for the DND and the CAF, is responsible for advertising, visual identity and the Federal Identity Program (FIP), and the printing of communications products.

**3.3** In these areas ADM(PA) is responsible for:

1.  planning, implementing and reporting all advertising for the DND;
2.  reporting all publishing of communications products to central government agencies using the relevant communications products databases, as required by paragraph 6.4 of the Treasury Board _Procedures for Publishing_; and
3.  oversight of the DND/CAF visual identity and monitoring its application on communications products.

4\. Procedures for Advertising
------------------------------

**Context**

**4.1** In accordance with the _Directive on the Management of Communications_, ADM(PA) is responsible for developing the DND/CAF annual advertising plan. Under the Treasury Board _Policy on Communications and Federal Identity_, the DM is responsible for approving the advertising plan.

**4.2** Advertising strategies and campaigns included in the advertising plan are based on recruitment priorities and target groups established by the Canadian Forces Recruiting Group (CFRG) for the Regular Force, and the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Canadian Army (CA), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Forces Health Services Group (CF H Svcs Gp) for their Reserve Force recruitment campaigns. Other level one advisors (L1s) must, in order to ensure the recruitment needs for their organizations are considered in developing the priorities that inform the advertising plan, consult with:

1.  CFRG for their Regular Force recruitment needs; and
2.  ADM(PA) for their Reserve Force recruitment needs.

**4.3** The Director General Marketing and E-Communications (DGMEC) organization in ADM(PA) works with the Privy Council Office (PCO) to develop the advertising plan, following the GC advertising process. The plan is included with other departmental advertising plans in the GC annual advertising plan approved by Cabinet.

**4.4** In accordance with the _Directive on the Management of Communications_, Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) is responsible for managing the procurement process for all contracted advertising activities. Before proceeding with any stage of the procurement process, i.e. from request for information to contract award, PSPC may consult with legal, cost analysts and other contracting policy specialists with respect to the tendering process, sufficiency of the contract, risk analysis, compliance, etc.

**4.5** ADM(PA) as the designated authority carries out all DND/CAF advertising activities included in the GC annual advertising plan, in accordance with the _Directive on the Management of Communications_ and its _Mandatory Procedures for Advertising_.

**4.6** L1s must ensure that any planned activities in their organizations do not fall within the definition of advertising as set out in section 2. All advertising activities must be carried out only by ADM(PA).

**4.7** Social media campaigns without paid promotion and public service announcements that are disseminated without charge are not considered advertising.

**Requirements**

**4.8** For all DND/CAF advertising campaigns with a media buy of over $1 million, ADM(PA) conducts a standardized pre- and post-campaign evaluation.

**4.9** ADM(PA) ensures that all advertising campaigns with media buys over $250,000 are reviewed to ensure that creative materials are non-partisan. Ad Standards, the external organization that administers the _Canadian Code of Advertising Standards_, conducts these reviews on behalf of the GC to ensure that creative materials are non-partisan.

**4.10** For all advertising media buys greater than $25,000, ADM(PA) must in respect of:

1.  #### Planning and Coordination
    
    1.  coordinate the planning of advertising activities;
    2.  establish performance indicators for advertising campaigns; and
    3.  consult with other departments and agencies when planning to advertise in foreign markets.
2.  #### Contracting Advertising Activities
    
    1.  work with contracting authorities for the procurement of advertising services, including planning, pretesting, production, media placement and evaluation;
    2.  work with contracting authorities to develop statements of work and obtain project registration numbers before contracts are awarded;
    3.  manage advertising contracts after they have been awarded; and
    4.  inform contracting authorities of any changes to the scope of work, amendments to contracts or the media-buy strategy.
3.  #### Production and Media Planning
    
    1.  ensure that creative materials are non-partisan;
    2.  ensure that advertising creative elements are in accordance with the _Official Languages Act_;
    3.  ensure that advertising activities consider the needs and interests of official language minority communities, as well as Indigenous and ethno-cultural communities;
    4.  apply gender-based analysis plus (GBA Plus);
    5.  submit draft creative elements, media buy strategies and plans to PCO for review;
    6.  forward draft creative elements, media buy strategies and plans to the PSPC Advertising Services Directorate for advice on compliance with legislative and policy requirements;
    7.  obtain required authorization numbers from contracting authorities; and
    8.  record information on all advertising activities in the database of the Advertising Management Information System (AdMIS), as is required throughout the life cycle of each advertising compaign.

**4.11** For all advertising activities with a media buy less than $25,000, ADM(PA) undertakes the production and media planning activities outlined in subparagraph 4.10c.

**4.12** ADM(PA) is required to report on all advertising expenditures that are disclosed in the _Annual Report on Government of Canada Advertising Activities_ as a requirement of paragraph 8.2.5 of the _Directive on the Management of Communications_.

**4.13** DND employees and CAF members should contact ADM(PA) at the following positional email address if they have any questions on advertising: Advertising-Publicite@forces.gc.ca.

**Non-Public Property Organizations**

**4.14** The advertising requirements in this DAOD do not apply to Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services (CFMWS) or other non-public property (NPP) organizations, including the:

*   Military Family Services Program (MFRC)
*   Canadian Forces Exchange System (CANEX)
*   Military Family Services (MFS)
*   Personnel Support Programs (PSP)

**4.15** The advertising requirements in this DAOD do not apply to the selling of advertising in media outlets administered by CFMWS or other NPP organizations.

**4.16** When L1s are considering advertising in media outlets administered by CFMWS, they must ensure that their organizations follow the requirements set out in the _Directive on the Management of Communications_ and its _Mandatory Procedures for Advertising_. Public expenditures on advertising are reported centrally to ensure transparency and accountability.

5\. Procedures for Publishing
-----------------------------

### Context

**5.1** The objective of the Treasury Board _Procedures for Publishing_ is to ensure that GC information is readily available and delivered to Canadians in a cost-effective manner.

**5.2** This DAOD implements these procedures in the DND and the CAF in order to ensure that information on DND/CAF actions to protect Canadians, serve Canada and its interests, and promote international peace and stability is accessible to Canadians in the Government of Canada Publications catalogue and the Library and Archives Canada (LAC) national collection.

### Requirements

**5.3** DND employees and CAF members must report communications products in the DND Index of Communications Products (DND ICP) database immediately after publishing by entering the product information. A complete list of the types of communications products that must be reported can be found on the ADM(PA) intranet site, _Index of Communications Products database_.

**5.4** ADM(PA) maintains the DND ICP database and reports twice a year (November and April) to PSPC, as directed in the _Procedures for Publishing_, or as otherwise requested by PSPC.

**5.5** DND employees and CAF members should contact ADM(PA) if they have any questions about how to report their communications products in the DND ICP database.

**5.6** Publications that are books or book-like must contain an International Standard Book Number (ISBN). PSPC defines book-like products as including pamphlets, booklets, brochures, educational kits, and other print and digital portable publications and videos. Products that are ongoing publications, such as periodicals, newspapers or journals, must contain an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). All GC publications require a GC catalogue number.

6\. Procedures for Visual Identity
----------------------------------

### Context

**6.1** The DND/CAF visual identity comprises the application of FIP symbols, including the following:

1.  the Canada wordmark and National Defence corporate signature;
2.  the badges’ component of the CAF identity system (see DAOD 5040-2, _Canadian Armed Forces Identity System_); and
3.  the limited practical application of FIP symbols in communications products of CAF organizations and on other material and assets.

**6.2** If communications products are CAF-only, FIP symbols do not need to be applied.

**6.3** ADM(PA) provides direction and advice on visual identity for communications products.

**6.4** This DAOD should be read in conjunction with section 4 of DAOD 2008-0, _Public Affairs Policy_, and DAOD 5040-2.

### Requirements

**6.5** DND/CAF communications products must comply with the requirements set out in the _DND-CAF Visual Identity Guide_ and apply the appropriate internal or external templates.

**6.6** Unique templates for internal communications products, e.g. report covers, posters, roll-up displays, etc., have been developed for each L1 while aligning with the DND/CAF visual identity. Communications products for external audiences, regardless of the L1, program or activity, must adopt the DND/CAF visual identity for communicating with external audiences.

**6.7** New DND logos and identifiers are only to be developed and used with the express approval of the Treasury Board Secretariat.

**6.8** Military identity and heraldry are managed by the Directorate of History and Heritage (DHH) through the environmental heritage staff. Direction on the creation and use of CAF badges and insignia is set out in the _Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces_. The Inspector of CAF Colours and Badges, an officer appointed by the CDS, is responsible for overseeing the process by which colours and badges for the CAF are authorized, designed, used and disposed of.

**6.9** DND employees and CAF members should contact ADM(PA) at the following positional email address if they have any questions on DND/CAF visual identity, or the application or use of official symbols: ADMPADesign@forces.gc.ca.

**6.10** DND employees and CAF members should contact environmental heritage staff or DHH if they have any questions on the use of CAF badges.

7.  Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

### Compliance

**7.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**7.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may result in administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee, and administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member. Non-compliance may also result in the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.
