**official capacity** (_à titre officiel_)

The term "official capacity" means "as a CF member or DND employee in the exercise of their duties".

**public announcement** (_annonce publique_)

A public announcement refers to an official public statement or public affairs activity designed to inform the public of a new initiative, or the DND and/or CAF's position on a policy, program, service, operation, activity, initiative, issue and/or crisis. Examples include issuing a news release or bulletin to inform the public of a new policy, program, service, base opening/closure, special event and/or changes in a CAF operation.

* * *

3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The overriding objective of Public Affairs (PA) is to ensure that Canadians are well-informed and aware of the role, mandate, operations and contributions of the DND and the CAF.

**3.2** Canadians expect and deserve to know what the DND and the CAF do on their behalf, whether it is saving lives through search and rescue, providing humanitarian assistance, maintaining combat-capable forces in defence of Canada and Canadian interests and values or contributing to international peace and security.

**3.3** As public ambassadors of the CAF and DND, CF members and DND employees are important spokespeople. The media, in turn, represent important channels through which to communicate with Canadians. It is therefore important to nurture and maintain open and positive relations with the media as a way of reaching out to Canadians and providing them with information about how the CAF and DND make a difference.

**3.4** It is imperative that the information provided to the public by the CAF and DND is accurate and up-to-date. It is also imperative for CF members and DND employees to respect the principle of operational security, the judicial process with respect to matters before the courts, and federal laws including the _Privacy Act_, the _Access to Information Act_, the _National Defence Act_, and the _Official Secrets Act_.

**3.5** The intent of this DAOD is to establish operating principles, requirements and guidelines for CF members and DND employees for building, nurturing and maintaining a strong relationship with Canadians based on a approach to media relations that is open and transparent within the law.

**3.6** To this end, this DAOD:

1.  empowers and encourages DND employees and CF members to speak to the media about what they do in their official capacity as a valuable and important way to provide Canadians with a richer understanding of the day-to-day operations and contributions of the CAF and DND;
2.  provides DND employees and CF members with guidance on when to seek advice or refer media requests for information that fall outside of their personal experience to their respective chain of command or PA;
3.  makes all DND employees or CF members accountable for the accuracy of the information they make available to the media or public; and
4.  delegates authority to approve information concerning DND and CAF policies, programs, services, operations, and activities for release to the media or public to a level that is consistent with DND and CAF accountabilities for other management functions.

4\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Principal Spokespersons

**4.1** The Minister of National Defence is the government's principal advocate for defence matters, both within Cabinet and externally on its behalf.

**4.2** As the government's principal spokesperson for the DND and the CAF, the Minister is responsible for informing the public about DND and CAF priorities, policies, programs, operations and initiatives.

**4.3** The Minister is supported in this role by:

*   the CDS, who is the principal spokesperson for the CAF;
*   the DM, who is the principal spokesperson for the DND; and
*   other subject matter experts, as required.

### Primary Media Contacts

**4.4** Public Affairs Officers (PAOs) are the primary points of contact for media and public enquiries.

**4.5** As primary media contacts, PAOs should:

1.  be as prompt and responsive as possible, within the limits of the law, when dealing with media enquiries, while recognizing that journalists often face extremely tight deadlines; and
2.  build, nurture and maintain open and positive relations with the media.

### CF members and DND employees Responding to Requests for Media Interviews in their Official Capacity

**4.6** CF members and DND employees may agree to be interviewed in their official capacity by the media provided it is to speak about what they do.

**4.7** When dealing with a media request for an interview or information concerning what they do, CF members and DND employees:

1.  can seek advice and support from PA through their chain of command, when desired or when in doubt about how to respond;
2.  can agree to be interviewed only if they personally want to;
3.  shall discuss only their own job within their personal areas of experience or expertise;
4.  shall consult the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) or the Military Police when the interview request concerns an investigation currently in progress; and
5.  shall respect the principle of operational security, the judicial process with respect to matters before the courts, and federal laws and policies such as the _Privacy Act_ governing the disclosure of information to the public.

**4.8** In addition, CF members and DND employees speaking in their official capacity, including designated subject matters experts and PAOs, shall not:

1.  respond to media queries that fall outside of their personal areas of experience or expertise, unless authorized to do so;
2.  undermine the safety of personnel involved in, or the potential success of, a CAF operation;
3.  provide comments that could undermine the integrity of an investigation currently in progress;
4.  speculate about events, incidents, issues or future policy decisions;
5.  offer personal opinion on government, DND or CAF policy; or
6.  discuss advice given to the Minister, Cabinet or the chain of command.

**(amended 2000-04-11)**

### Public Announcements

**4.9** When considering public announcements, Commanding Officers (COs) and DND managers at all levels shall:

1.  keep their superiors informed of public announcement plans and activities, in advance and in a timely manner;
2.  engage PA early in the planning process for advice and support;
3.  take into account the national dimensions of local announcements and link the announcement to broad government programs, as appropriate (especially when the announcement involves a significant commitment of public funds); and
4.  respect the need for PAOs to use the PA technical network as an important channel through which public announcements and media relations activities are coordinated across the CAF and DND, and with the federal government as a whole.
