3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** Like all organizations, the DND and the CAF must be prepared to deal with issues.

**3.2** When dealing with an issue, an organization must take action to effectively address any related problems to minimize the chances of the issue escalating into a crisis, while proactively keeping the public informed of its actions in a timely and accurate manner.

**3.3** Effective management of an issue, both open and within the law, minimizes the likelihood of its escalation into a crisis. In contrast, issues that are poorly managed affect the credibility of an organization, undermining staff or public confidence and contributing to the emergence of crises.

**3.4** For these reasons, it is necessary for organizations to respond to issues and crises quickly and decisively and, subject to security policy, in as open a fashion as possible.

**3.5** Since many issues evolve rapidly, the key to managing them effectively involves a coordinated response that emphasizes:

1.  identifying and reporting on actual or potential issues;
2.  taking action to address and resolve issues quickly and effectively; and
3.  keeping the public informed of what the DND and the CAF are doing to address the issues and why.

### Operating Principles

**3.6** When faced with an issue or crisis, the DND and the CAF should ensure that the requirement to inform the public is not delayed by the search for solutions. Instead, the DND and the CAF should acknowledge the problem and inform the public as corrective actions are being considered or undertaken, then keep the public informed of developments as they occur.

**Note -** Operational security and protection of personal information under the _Privacy Act_ shall be maintained at all times.

4\. Reporting Issues and Significant Incidents
----------------------------------------------

### Responsibility to Inform

**4.1** DND employees and CAF members shall immediately communicate details regarding issues or significant incidents that could have national repercussions through their chain of command to the Issue OPI and the Canadian Forces Integrated Command Centre (CFICC) by the fastest means possible. Similarly, Issue OPIs and CFICC shall immediately advise ADM(PA), CDS and DM of the significant incident or national issue at hand.

**4.2** DND employees and CAF members shall observe applicable security policy, including the requirement in some matters for the distribution of information on a need-to-know basis only, in the communication of information in respect of issues and significant incidents.

### Significant Incident Reports

**4.3** Commanding officers shall submit Significant Incident Reports (SIRs) through their chain of command to the Issue OPI, CFICC and ADM(PA), in addition to any other organization, e.g., operational headquarters, that may need such information.

**4.4** A Canadian task force commander shall report any incidents of national interest directly to CFICC and provide a copy to the appropriate environmental chief of staff (ECS) or force generator who is OPI for the mission or operation.

**4.5** SIRs shall be sent by message. If circumstances dictate, SIRs should first be reported by telephone to the Issue OPI, CFICC and ADM(PA) in that order, and then confirmed by priority message.

**4.6** As SIRs are official records, appropriate tone and perspective shall be maintained.

**4.7** Submission of an SIR does not preclude the requirement to file other reports and returns in accordance with current regulations and orders, e.g., aircraft accident reports, military police reports, and others.

**4.8** If confirmation of details is unavailable, the report shall be sent with the best information available at the time, and updates shall be used to correct or add detail. Unconfirmed information shall be annotated as such.

### SIR Message Format

**4.9** Information in an SIR message should be provided in the following format:

| Paragraph | Significant Incident Report |
| --- | --- |
| 1
 | Date, time and location of the significant incident.

 |
| 2

 | Name, location and telephone number of the person or agency initially reporting the incident.

 |
| 3

 | Who or what was involved, what happened and how it happened.

 |
| 4

 | Name of the parent unit and specific information concerning the persons and equipment involved.

 |
| 5

 | Any possible broader implications of the incident, including the effect on future operations.

 |
| 6

 | Local public affairs actions, recommendations and proposed further action.

 |
| 7

 | Details of actual and probable media interest and involvement, including number of media calls, interviews and information requests, and whether the media were national, local or international.

 |

### Personal Information and Release of SIRs

**4.10** Personal information is defined in section 3 of the _Privacy Act_ and includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, marital status, medical, criminal or employment history, home address or blood type of an individual. Personal information does not include the name of a person, position title or rank, business address or business telephone number.

**4.11** The following information shall not be included in SIRs:

1.  any personal information in respect of a person under the age of 18 years;
2.  a personal address; or
3.  any personal information concerning a suspect or an accused person if a criminal or service offence may have occurred.

**4.12** DND employees and CAF members shall contact the Directorate of Access to Information and Privacy (DAIP) if there is any doubt as to the application of the _Privacy Act_ with regards to any use of personal information in an SIR.

**4.13** Upon request, SIRs may be released subject to any legal and policy requirements, such as the _Privacy Act_ and the _Policy on Government Security_.

**Note -** Section 38 of the _Young Offenders Act_ prohibits the publication of any information that would identify a person under the age of 18 who:

1.  has committed or is alleged to have committed an offence; or
2.  is a victim or a witness appearing before the court in respect to that offence.

### Examples of Significant Incidents

**4.14** The following are examples of significant incidents that shall be reported:

1.  accidental release of hazardous material that may threaten public safety;
2.  accidents involving damage to DND or CAF equipment or property, including aircraft, ships, munitions or weapons, if more than $50,000;
3.  actions by DND employees or CAF members that may undermine public values, or lead to the discredit of Canada at home or abroad;
4.  actions by DND employees or CAF members that constitute a significant breach of any act of Parliament;
5.  alteration or destruction of official records;
6.  fires involving death, injury, suspected arson, losses of more than $50,000, or damage to civilian property stemming from the spread of fire from DND or CAF property;
7.  hostile acts against CAF members employed in operations;
8.  hostile acts against the DND or the CAF, including actual or suspected incidents of information warfare;
9.  injury or death of DND employees or CAF members when the circumstances are such as to give rise to public comment;
10.  national or international incidents that may have an impact on the ability of the DND or the CAF to deliver policies, programs, services or operations; and
11.  acts or threats of terrorism, or discovery by or referral to the CAF of actual or suspected explosive devices, armaments or other ordnance.

**Note** **\-** Many of these significant incidents involve reporting procedures external to the public affairs context. While these incidents shall be reported as potential issues or crises, they shall also be reported in accordance with other regulations, orders and directives, as required, and classified appropriately.
