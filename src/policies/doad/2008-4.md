3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The key priority during any CF operation is to achieve its mission, whether the mission is oriented toward war, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, or assistance to law enforcement agencies.

**3.2** At the same time, the demand for information concerning the activities of the CAF during an operation increases substantially due to heightened media and public interest.

**3.3** The requirement to inform in these instances is usually divided into two spheres of information. The first sphere is national, and it concerns the demand for information related to the Government's decision to deploy the CAF and the nature of the CAF's mandate for the operation. The second is operational, and it concerns the demand for information regarding the structure, people and activities of deployed forces.

**3.4** The challenge for public affairs (PA) is to inform Canadians of both the national **_and_** operational dimensions of CF operation in a manner that is accurate, complete, timely and respectful of the principles of openness, transparency and operational security. This requires the effective integration of PA into all aspects of military operations, from doctrine to the execution and coordination of PA in theatre during operations.

**3.5** To this end, the intent of this DAOD is to provide CF members and DND employees, particularly Commanders, military planners and public affairs officers (PAO), with guidance for:

1.  integrating the operating principles of the DND and CAF PA policy into military doctrine;
2.  integrating PA operational requirements into military planning, decision making and the implementation of activites for CF operations at home or abroad; and
3.  coordinating the national and operational dimensions of PA during CF operations between deployed commanders and PAOs in-theatre, National Defence Headquarters and the Government.

### Scope

**3.6** This DAOD applies to CF operations of an international or national scope or nature, including regional operations that have a national dimension. United Nations peacekeeping operations unless otherwise directed, CF operations in aid of the civil power, and CAF operational support to diplomatic conferences within Canada are all examples of operations that fall within the scope of this DAOD.

**3.7** This DAOD does not apply to CF operations involving routine local or regional deployments within Canada. CAF deployments in support of routine search and rescue operations and regional CAF exercises are both examples of operations that are excluded from this DAOD.

### Operating Principles

**3.8** The safety of CAF personnel and the integrity of military operations constitute fundamental principles, underlying everything the CAF does on behalf of Canadians.

**3.9** For this reason, the principles of openness and transparency should be balanced against the principle of operational security during CF operations.

**3.10** In respecting the principle of operational security, no PA activity should undermine:

1.  the safety of personnel involved in a CF operation; or
2.  the likely success of a CF operation or activity.

**3.11** The principle of operational security may place limits on the CAF's ability to live up to demands for complete openness; however, every effort should be made by CF members and DND employees to be as open and transparent as possible within the law when informing the public about CAF activities during military operations.
