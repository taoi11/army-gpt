3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** Canadians expect and deserve value-for-money. As such, DND and CAF investments in public affairs (PA) must be prudent, cost-effective and add value to the efforts of the CAF and DND to serve Canadians and Canadian interests and values.

**3.2** This involves:

1.  delivering high-quality PA programs, materials and activities that inform the public of CAF and DND policies, programs, services, operations, activities and initiatives in a manner that is accurate, complete, objective, open within the law, timely, relevant and understandable;
2.  ensuring that PA programs, materials and activities reflect the needs of their intended audiences and are consistent with modern Canadian values; and
3.  directing PA investments to where they will contribute most to the achievement of CAF and DND priorities and to public understanding and awareness of what the CAF and DND do on behalf of Canadians.

**3.3** To achieve these objectives, PA investments must be planned, managed and coordinated. PA resources must be allocated to maximize return on investments. PA materials must meet basic standards in terms of language quality, clarity, accessibility and availability. The CAF and DND must be visible, accessible and answerable to the public it serves.

**3.4** To this end, this DAOD establishes requirements, procedures and guidelines for CF members and DND employees for PA planning and program delivery for major PA functional areas, including advertising, audio-visual and multi-media production, corporate internal communications, imagery, PA photography, PA research, publishing, and PA training.
