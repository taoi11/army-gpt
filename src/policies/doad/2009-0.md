The following are not conferences:

*   technical advisory committee meetings where the participants are directly involved in resolving problems related specifically to work normally assigned to them; and
*   training seminars or courses.

International conferences involve representatives of the federal government and the governments of one or more foreign countries.

**level 1 advisors** (_conseillers principaux_)

Level 1 Advisors are identified in the Position Equivalency Table in Support of the Delegation Matrix, _Delegation of Authorities for Financial Administration for DND and the CF_ (A-FN-100-002/AG-006).

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Policy Statement

**3.1** Conference sponsorship and attendance must be directly related to program objectives of the DND and the CAF and must be conducted with diligence and financial restraint.

**3.2** The levels of hospitality accepted or offered must follow the DAOD series 1017, _Hospitality in Canada_.

### Requirements

**3.3** Sponsorship of conferences must be pre-authorized by the Deputy Minister (DM). Where hospitality funds required for the conference exceed $5,000, Ministerial approval is required. Accordingly, approval for sponsorship of conferences must be sought well in advance of the event.

1.  Participation must be co-ordinated to ensure that:
    1.  the DND and the CAF are not over-represented and thus, subject to public criticism; and
    2.  attendance is limited to the minimum number necessary to meet the objectives of the DND and the CAF.
2.  Conferences that can be forecasted must be included in business plans.
