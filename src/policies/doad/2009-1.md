4\. Sponsorship Guidelines
--------------------------

### General Principles

1.  Requests for sponsorship approval must be forwarded to the Deputy Minister (DM) or Minister, as required, through the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS).
2.  The DND and the CAF may not sponsor more than two major international conferences per year.
3.  Requests must include a breakdown of all anticipated expenses, including hospitality (see DAOD 1017-0, _Hospitality in Canada_).
4.  Approval of sponsorship requests represents approval of an expenditure ceiling.
5.  Sponsorship of international conferences requires a minimum planning time of two years.

### Geographic Location

**4.1** CAF/DND-sponsored conferences should take place in the most economical geographic location, taking into account the participants' travel expenses.

### Facilities

**4.2** CAF/DND-sponsored conferences should take place in CAF/DND facilities, provided the location or its use does not compromise conference objectives. If CF/DND facilities are not available, other Government facilities should be used. For advice on the location and availability of Government facilities, contact the appropriate regional office of Public Works and Government Service Canada (PWGSC).

**4.3** If neither CAF/DND facilities nor Government facilities are available, commercial facilities may be used. For further guidance on this matter, see the heading "General Guidelines".

### Liaison With Other Government Departments and Agencies

**4.4** When a decision has been made to sponsor a conference, the interests of other government departments and agencies must be considered and proper liaison established, where applicable.

**4.5** If the conference is international, the sponsor shall consult the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT). For more information, contact D Pub Pol.

### Official Languages

**4.6** The requirements of the _Official Languages Act_ must be respected (e.g. simultaneous interpretation, translation, the production of documents in both official languages).

### Funding

**4.7** Level 1 Advisors shall provide conference funding as budgeted for in their business plans. Consideration should be given to alternate forms of funding such as:

1.  cost-sharing;
2.  cost-recovery;
3.  donations; and
4.  external sponsorship, where the conference is organized and run completely by an outside party as a non-government conference.

**4.8** With regard to donations, CAF members and DND employees shall first ensure that receiving funds in this manner is appropriate and does not create a conflict of interest situation.

**4.9** With regard to external sponsorship, arrangements must be set up so that they cannot be construed as a contractual arrangement on behalf of, or as agent for the CAF and the DND.

**4.10** Treasury Board (TB) Information Bulletin dated November 1, 1995, _Financing of Conferences and Seminars_ provides further details on these forms of funding.

**Note -** The provisions of DAOD 1017-0, _Hospitality in Canada_, TB travel directives and departmental and CAF travel regulations and orders apply to conferences sponsored by the CAF and/or the DND.
