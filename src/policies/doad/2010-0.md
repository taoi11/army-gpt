1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2006-09-08

**Application:** This is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** This DAOD is issued under the authority of the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS).

**Enquiries:** Director General Force Development Analysis (DGFDA)

* * *

2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** The development and assessment of new defence doctrines, concepts and technology applications using actual equipment and real world trials has proven to be time-consuming, expensive and restrictive. As a result, modelling and simulation (M&S) technology has become a primary enabling technology in allied countries for the definition, development and delivery of transformational defence capabilities across the spectrum of conflict. M&S tools can enable this transformation by:

1.  stimulating synergy, and strengthening and extending previously discrete life cycle activities; and
2.  bringing a degree of consistency and concurrency across the spectrum of activities, from research to operations, that have been previously unattainable.

**2.2** The use of M&S technology offers a means to assess concepts and events not possible in the real world due to unacceptable risk or cost. M&S, including synthetic environments, merge the real and virtual worlds in ways that empower leaders to:

1.  visualize the future;
2.  analyze decision alternatives; and
3.  prepare for domestic and coalition operations throughout the spectrum of conflict.

**2.3** In the _Creating the CF of 2020: Concept Development and Experimentation and Modelling and Simulation_ discussion paper, the use of M&S is recognized as a key supporting activity in the creation of future forces and for meeting the objectives of Strategy 2020. The use of M&S can provide the DND and the CAF with a powerful and resource-efficient medium for:

1.  exploration of doctrinal alternatives;
2.  capability management;
3.  alternative operational training;
4.  investigation of leading-edge technologies; and
5.  effective support to the acquisition process.

### Policy Statement

**2.4** The DND and the CAF are committed to using M&S as a primary enabling technology necessary to effectively meet objectives in an affordable, reusable and interoperable context within the DND and the CAF and with allied countries.

### Requirements

**2.5** The DND and the CAF shall:

1.  provide guidance for the analysis, development and implementation of coordinated and cooperative M&S initiatives;
2.  develop a DND and CAF Strategic M&S Plan;
3.  provide education and training in the DND and the CAF for M&S;
4.  establish a coordination office in the DND and the CAF for M&S;
5.  establish DND and CAF M&S standards and best practices;
6.  develop and maintain a bank of shareable M&S information and assets with the appropriate level of verification, validation and accreditation to promote reusability, enhancement, commonality and interoperability;
7.  designate an M&S authority for each environmental chief of staff (ECS), group principal and Operational Commanders; and
8.  establish a DND and CAF stakeholder working group as required.
