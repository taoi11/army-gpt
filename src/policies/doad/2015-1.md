3\. Overview
------------

**Context**

**3.1** The _Aeronautics Act_ applies to all aspects of military aviation, including the design, manufacture, maintenance, materiel support and operation of military aeronautical products, and the investigation of military aviation safety-related occurrences and issues.

**3.2** Ensuring the airworthiness of military aeronautical products, including their operation, and establishing control over various facilities and services relating to military aviation, contribute significantly to the objective of military aviation safety.

**Aim**

**3.3** The aim of the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program is to ensure that an acceptable level of aviation safety is achieved and maintained for military aviation.

**Objective**

**3.4** The DND/CAF Airworthiness Program is intended to provide a framework for the regulation of military aviation.

4\. Operating Structure
-----------------------

**Program Requirements**

**4.1** The DND/CAF Airworthiness Program is established to:

1.  promote and support the objective of aviation safety;
2.  regulate activities associated with the design, manufacture, maintenance, materiel support and operation of military aeronautical products;
3.  ensure that airworthiness instruments for military aviation are established and issued by the appropriate authorities;
4.  ensure that only authorized individuals who are qualified and competent perform airworthiness-related activities;
5.  apply risk management principles to situations if the application of the Aeronautics Act and airworthiness instruments may impact military operations;
6.  investigate military aviation safety-related occurrences and issues, and formulate preventive measures;
7.  provide oversight of all airworthiness activities associated with military aviation; and
8.  regulate the provision of facilities and services necessary for the safe operation of military aeronautical products.

**4.2** For additional detailed information on the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program, see A-GA-005-000/AG-001, _DND/CAF Airworthiness Program_.

**Airworthiness Authorities**

**4.3** Pursuant to the _Ministerial Airworthiness Direction_ of 18 July 2005, the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) may designate authorities for the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program and delegate necessary powers, duties and functions. The following four designated authorities for the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program have been established by CDS orders:

1.  Airworthiness Authority (AA);
2.  Operational AA (OAA);
3.  Technical AA (TAA); and
4.  Airworthiness Investigative Authority (AIA).

**Note –** For the consistency of airworthiness terminology in DND and CAF airworthiness publications, the French term used for “Airworthiness Investigative Authority” (AIA) is "Autorité des enquêtes sur la navigabilité” (AEN), not "Directeur des enquêtes sur la navigabilité” as set out in the Aeronautics Act.

**Medical Advisor**

**4.4** The person holding the position of medical adviser to the C Air Force has been designated as the “medical advisor” for the purpose of subsection 6.5(1) of the _Aeronautics Act_. This subsection requires that a medical advisor designated by the Minister of National Defence (MND) be informed of the medical or optometric condition of a person mentioned in that subsection if the condition is likely to constitute a hazard to aviation safety.

**Special Advisors to Airworthiness Advisor**

**4.5** Due to the specialized nature of aerospace medicine and engineering flight testing, which form an integral part of the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program, the Aerospace Medical Authority (AMA) and the Flight Test Authority (FTA) act as special advisors to the airworthiness authorities.

**Program Governance**

**4.6** The DND/CAF Airworthiness Program is governed by the following boards:

1.  the Airworthiness Advisory Board (AAB); and
2.  the Airworthiness Review Board (ARB).

**Airworthiness Advisory Board**

**4.7** The AAB is chaired by the AA and is established to:

1.  assist the AA in the development of recommendations to the MND and the CDS on airworthiness matters related to military aviation;
2.  coordinate airworthiness requirements and objectives of the AA, OAA, TAA, AIA, AMA and FTA; and
3.  provide direction to appropriate individuals within the chain of command structure who have authority to implement necessary actions under the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program.

**4.8** Recommendations arising from the AAB must be actioned by the airworthiness authorities, OAA, TAA and AIA as AAs designated by the CDS or in their capacities as office holders in the DND and the CAF organizational structure. The AAB meets as required but no less than once per year.

**Airworthiness Review Board**

**4.9** The ARB is co-chaired by the OAA and TAA, and is established to:

1.  manage the interface between the operational and technical airworthiness of each aircraft type;
2.  recommend the airworthiness clearance of new aircraft types to the AA and approve the airworthiness clearance of significantly modified aircraft types if required;
3.  conduct an annual review of the airworthiness clearance of all in-service aircraft types; and
4.  address observations and concerns raised by the AA, AIA, AMA or FTA.

**4.10** The ARB normally meets on a semi-annual basis or as the situation requires.

5\. Airworthiness Instruments
-----------------------------

**Issuance of Airworthiness Instruments and Compliance**

**5.1** Under the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program, designated airworthiness authorities may issue airworthiness instruments, other than regulations, for the:

1.  design, manufacture, maintenance, materiel support and operation of military aeronautical products;
2.  provision of facilities and services necessary for the safe operation of military aeronautical products, including air navigation systems and aerospace control;
3.  investigation of military aviation safety-related occurrences and issues; and
4.  training, qualification and authorization or licensing of personnel who perform airworthiness-related activities.

**Compliance**

**5.2** The designated airworthiness authorities and the special advisors must ensure that:

1.  only trained, qualified and authorized personnel perform airworthiness-related activities; and
2.  the _Aeronautics Act_ and all applicable airworthiness instruments are followed.
