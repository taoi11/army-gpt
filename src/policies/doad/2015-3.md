4\. Overview
------------

**Interpretation**

**4.1** In this DAOD:

*   “aircraft” includes a UAS unless the context requires otherwise; and
*   “FG” includes an L1 who may procure and operate a UAS.

**Context**

**4.2** The _Aeronautics Act_ is the legal foundation for military aviation safety. Ensuring the airworthiness of military aeronautical products contributes significantly to the objective of military aviation safety.

**Aim**

**4.3** The aim of the RTS process set out in this DAOD is to ensure the airworthiness of any aircraft that enters operational service or has undergone any major upgrade resulting in a substantial change to the technical or operational nature of the original AC.

**RTS Approval**

**4.4** Subject to paragraph 4.5, an RTS must be approved by the Comd RCAF as the FG for all manned aircraft, Class I and II UAS generated by the RCAF and all Class III UAS, and by other FGs for Class I and II UAS generated by their commands:

1.  prior to the commencement of operational service of the aircraft; and
2.  following the completion of a major upgrade project that results in a substantial change to the technical or operational nature of the original AC.

**4.5** Some aircraft, particularly UAS, may have multiple FGs involved in developing and implementing a process for achieving RTS. In those cases, a primary FG must assume responsibility for approving RTS on their combined behalf.

**RTS Exceptions**

**4.6** C Air Force as the AA is the approving authority for any exceptions related to the RTS of aircraft. D Air Rdns should be contacted for information concerning conditions for RTS exceptions.

[Top of page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/2000-series/2015/2015-3-release-to-service.html#wb-tphp)

5\. Release to Service Process  

---------------------------------

**Requirements**

**5.1** The achievement of RTS of an aircraft requires the granting of both an AC and an RE.

**Airworthiness Clearance**

**5.2** C Air Force as the AA grants an AC based on an OAC, a TAC and an IAC as provided by the OAA, the TAA and the AIA, respectively. Once the AC is granted, the completed AC report is provided by D Air Rdns to the FG.

**Note –** For the consistency of airworthiness terminology in DND and CAF airworthiness publications, the French term used for “Airworthiness Investigative Authority” (AIA) is "Autorité des enquêtes sur la navigabilité” (AEN), not "Directeur des enquêtes sur la navigabilité” as set out in the _Aeronautics Act_.

**Provisional Airworthiness Clearance**

**5.3** There may be instances when an AC is required before the full OAC, TAC and/or IAC can be issued. If the AA is satisfied that sufficient operational, technical and investigative airworthiness provisions are in place, e.g. POAC, PTAC and PIAC, a PAC may be granted. The PAC must:

1.  be supported by a detailed written review of airworthiness requirements; and
2.  identify a timeline for completion of the full AC.

**Readiness Endorsement**

**5.4** The FG grants RE based on operational, project and/or program requirements, as applicable, and ISS requirements. Examples of RE components and key criteria for readiness are found in the table to paragraph 5.5. Project management offices may find additional information on key measures in the _Project Approval Directive_.

**5.5** The following table identifies examples of RE components and key criteria for readiness:

<table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td class="text-center"><strong>RE Components</strong></td><td class="text-center"><strong>Key Criteria for Readiness</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>Operational Requirements</p></td><td><ul><li>statement of operational requirement;</li><li>statement of operating intent;</li><li>statement of support intent;</li><li>master implementation plan;</li><li>RTS plan;</li><li>operations and maintenance funding;</li><li>organizational staff;</li><li>sufficient trained and certified personnel;</li><li>achievement of initial operational capability; and</li><li>limiting factors to full operational capability.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Project Requirements</td><td><ul><li>established contracts with industry;</li><li>project management plan;</li><li>funding to introduce aircraft and initial sustainability;</li><li>ISS, i.e. engineering, logistics, maintenance, IT, infrastructure, publications and training;</li><li>aircraft mission readiness, i.e. tested, accepted and delivered; and</li><li>project handover and closure plan.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>ISS Requirements</td><td><ul><li>weapon system manager;</li><li>funding to sustain the capability;</li><li>organizational staff; and</li><li>ISS, i.e. engineering, logistics, maintenance, IT, infrastructure, publications and training.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

**5.6** Certain UAS may require other forms of RE, such as when the UAS forms part of a larger system of systems having their own readiness or project closeout requirements, or both. If so, the FG must ensure that the applicable readiness criteria of the UAS are satisfied prior to the declaration of initial operational capability.

**Determination of the RTS Process**

**5.7** Once the FG receives the AC or PAC and approves the RE, the FG determines the RTS process in accordance with their project closeout or similar process.

**5.8** RCAF RTS boards must be conducted in accordance with AFO 8001-2, _Release to Service – New and Modified Aircraft Fleets_.

**5.9** RTS boards of other FGs must adopt a similar format in concert with the project closeout of their respective weapon system.

**5.10** The completed RTS report must be retained by the FG, with a copy distributed to D Air Rdns for registration and oversight as part of the DND/CAF Airworthiness Program (see DAOD 2015-0, _Airworthiness_, and DAOD 2015-1, _DND/CAF Airworthiness Program_).

6\.  Compliance and Consequences
--------------------------------

**Compliance**

**6.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military leaders have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**6.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military leaders for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may result in administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee, and administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member. Consequences of non-compliance may also include one or more of the following:

1.  cancellation of an approved AC or RTS, or both;
2.  the withdrawal of any authority or responsibility provided to a DND employee or CAF member under DAOD 2015-0, DAOD 2015-1 or this DAOD; and
3.  imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
