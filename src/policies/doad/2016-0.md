4\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**4.1** This DAOD applies to CAF flights for which passenger bookings are created using a DND passenger reservation system. For other CAF flights, see the _1 CAD Orders_.

**4.2** This DAOD does not apply to the approval of passengers to fly aboard a CAF aircraft on a flight that is conducted with a primary purpose of supporting the activities of an organization other than the DND or the CAF. Approval for passengers to fly on such a flight are governed by:

1.  the terms of the arrangement or agreement between the DND and the CAF, and the other organization under which the CAF aircraft is being provided; or
2.  in the absence of an arrangement or agreement that deals with passenger-carrying, an arrangement between the other organization and the Comd having operational control of the CAF aircraft.

**4.3** This DAOD sets out:

1.  the categories of passengers who are authorized to travel aboard a CAF flight, based on the principle that only those passengers traveling in support of, or in the interest of, the DND and the CAF, may be authorized to travel on a CAF flight; and
2.  the DND and CAF approval authorities who will determine the interest of the DND and the CAF.

**4.4** This DAOD does not convey authority to task or authorize a CAF flight.

**4.5** Approval to travel granted under this DAOD:

1.  does not guarantee a flight; and
2.  is subject to any requirement established by the Comd 1 CAD for passengers on certain aircraft types to have specific training or medical qualifications.

### Policy Statement

**4.6** The DND and the CAF are committed to ensuring that CAF flights are:

1.  operated in support of and in the interest of the DND and the CAF; and
2.  provided in a timely and efficient manner.

### Requirements

**4.7** All CAF flights authorized to carry passengers, with the exception of tactical and familiarization flights, must be entered into the current passenger reservation system in which a name record can be created for each passenger. Tactical and familiarization flights require an alternate manifest containing the name record to be created and held on the flight file.

* * *

5. Consequences
---------------

### General

**5.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.

* * *

6\. Authorities
---------------

### DOS SJS Authority

**6.1** DOS SJS has the authority to issue policies, directives and orders for duty travel and non-duty travel aboard a CAF flight. Policies, directives and orders previously issued by or on behalf of the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff remain in force until cancelled or otherwise amended by DOS SJS.

### Approval Authority Tables

**6.2** The passenger categories for duty travel and non-duty travel, and the applicable approval authorities who may authorize travel aboard a CAF flight, are set out in the following two tables:
