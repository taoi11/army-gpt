*   CFAO 49-10, _Terms of Service – Officers – Primary Reserve_, paragraph 4
*   CFAO 49-11, _Terms of Service – Non-Commissioned Members Primary Reserve_, paragraphs 3 and 4

**Approval Authority:** Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS)

**Enquiries:** Director of Reserves (D Res)

2\. Overview
------------

### Mission

**2.1** The mission of the Primary Reserve (P Res) sub-component is to provide the CAF with professional personnel at directed levels of readiness who will contribute to the capability of the CAF to achieve its roles and missions.

3\. Liability to Serve
----------------------

### Training

**3.1** The applicable authorities listed in the _Authority Table_ of DAOD 2020-0, _Reserve Force_, who exercise command over an element of the P Res sub-component must determine the minimum number of days of training required for a CAF member of the P Res (P Res member) under their command. Such determinations may not exceed the periods provided for under QR&O paragraph 9.04(2), _Training and Duty_, and are subject to any limitations prescribed by the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS).

**Note –** To date, the CDS has not prescribed any limitations to the training periods.

**3.2** P Res members must fulfil their minimum training requirements determined under paragraph 3.1 unless they are approved for an Exemption from Duty and Training (ED&T) under any of the provisions in QR&O Chapter 9, _Reserve Service_, section 4, _Exemption from Duty and Training_.

**3.3** P Res members who are not approved for an ED&T and who do not meet the minimum training requirements determined under paragraph 3.1 are considered “non-effective” and may be subject to administrative action, including release from the CAF.

4\. Organization
----------------

### Composition

**4.1** The P Res sub-component consists of CAF members who have agreed to train and perform lawful duties as may be required of them, whether on active service or not. P Res members are required to meet the same minimum operational standards related to the principle of universality of service as CAF members of the Regular Force (see DAOD 5023-1, _Minimum Operational Standards Related to Universality of Service_).

**4.2** The P Res sub-component consists of the following elements:

1.  the Naval Reserve;
2.  the Army Reserve;
3.  the Air Force Reserve;
4.  Military Personnel Command, which includes the Canadian Forces Health Services Reserve and the National Defence Headquarters P Res List (PRL);
5.  the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command Reserve; and
6.  the Judge Advocate General Reserve.

**4.3** Each element of the P Res sub-component may be composed of:

1.  detachments;
2.  units;
3.  formations;
4.  commands; and
5.  PRLs (see paragraph 4.5).

**4.4** The establishment of any unit of the CAF may include P Res positions.

### The PRLs

**4.5** PRLs are organizational entities established by the VCDS to provide for the proper and necessary career actions, including pay services, of P Res members who are serving with a unit other than a P Res unit or formation. For administrative purposes and career actions, each PRL is part of an appropriate environmental or other command.

### P Res Establishments

**4.6** All P Res members are assigned to authorized P Res positions.

**4.7** The VCDS has the sole authority to approve changes to the establishments of the P Res sub-component.

5\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**5.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for the CAF as an institution and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**5.2** The D Res is responsible for notifying the VCDS of any non-compliance with this DAOD.
