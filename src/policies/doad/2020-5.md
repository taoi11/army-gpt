* * *

2\. Overview
------------

**2.1** This DAOD outlines the policies and procedures governing reserve forces foreign service arrangements (RFFSAs). RFFSAs permit approved CAF Reserve Force (Res F) members to serve, for other than continuing full-time training and duty, with the reserve forces of foreign armed forces that have an RFFSA memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Department of National Defence (DND) or the CAF. This DAOD also includes the conditions under which the CAF would host a foreign reserve force member under an RFFSA MOU.

**Note –** Approved RFFSA MOUs are listed in the References section of this DAOD.

**2.2** An RFFSA MOU permits voluntary and individual participation with a foreign reserve force by a Res F member who temporarily resides within a host nation while attending school, working for a civilian employer on temporary assignment, accompanying a family member who is attending school or on a temporary work assignment, or some other similar reason. An RFFSA MOU allows for a Res F member to be retained by their CAF parent unit and remain on effective strength while taking advantage of opportunities to parade with a foreign reserve force unit.

**2.3** RFFSA MOUs also foster the development and maintenance of an active relationship between Canada and foreign countries that serves to promote interoperability between forces.

**2.4** RFFSA MOUs do not apply to attachments or secondments such as mutual exchanges or small unit exchanges which are governed by separate arrangements.

3\. Governance
--------------

**3.1** Approval and coordination of an RFFSA MOU are completed at the national level between signatory national defence officials. VCDS has delegated national authority to the Chief of Reserves and Employer Support (CRES) to sign RFFSA MOUs on behalf of the DND and the CAF.

 |

**Application**

**4.3** An RFFSA application should be received electronically by DIRO for consideration at least 90 days before the expected start of duty with a foreign reserve force unit. The application is to be sent directly from the applicant’s unit to DIRO, and to the appropriate chain of command for information.

**Application by Foreign Reserve Force Member**

**4.5** Any CAF unit could be informally contacted by a foreign reserve force member or unit to enquire about the possibility of RFFSA participation. If contacted, the CAF unit should seek advice from their chain of command or DIRO to apply the procedures in this DAOD and the applicable RFFSA MOU.

**Extension of RFFSA Period**

**4.6** Subject to paragraph 5.4, a Res F member may request an extension of an approved RFFSA period by submitting a written request to their parent unit CO.

2.  demonstration of parent unit CO support; and
3.  number of authorized paid training days over a defined period of time.
