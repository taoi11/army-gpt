3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**3.1** Materiel acquisition and support (MA&S) includes the resources and business functions required to acquire and support materiel throughout its entire life cycle. MA&S contributes to the defence capability of Canada by ensuring that the CAF is equipped with the right materiel in a timely manner, prepared to accomplish its roles and missions.

**3.2** In respect of the use of materiel and its impact on real property, immovables and the natural environment, level one advisors (L1s) are accountable to the Deputy Minister or the Chief of the Defence Staff, as applicable.

**Policy Statement**

**3.3** The DND and the CAF are committed to carrying out all MA&S activities in a manner that:

1.  supports the pre-eminence of CAF operational requirements, materiel performance and readiness;
2.  ensures value for money;
3.  focuses on the sound stewardship of materiel entrusted to the DND and the CAF;
4.  manages materiel in a sustainable and financially responsible manner that supports the cost effective and efficient delivery of DND and CAF programs;
5.  supports government objectives; and
6.  minimizes adverse environmental impacts, enhances sustainable development and meets legal obligations to Indigenous peoples.

**Requirements**

**3.4** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  acquire materiel and related materiel services in a manner that enhances access, competition, transparency, fairness, timeliness and pre-eminence of CAF operational requirements, while acting environmentally responsible and ensuring that all applicable laws, regulations, and government and DND and CAF policies, orders and directives, are respected in regard to procurement and contracting processes undertaken;
2.  exercise effective materiel management practices that minimize risk of loss or damage, maximize materiel visibility and ensure materiel is in the right place at the right time to support CAF operational objectives;
3.  ensure that procurement and sustainment of materiel optimizes the four foundational principles of performance, value for money, flexibility and economic benefits;
4.  implement an effective materiel assurance program to ensure equipment and fleets are safe, operational and fit for service;
5.  ensure that life-cycle costs and evidence are considered in investment decisions, including infrastructure construction in support of equipment;
6.  ensure that strategic decision-making, and materiel requirements and standards:
    1.  integrate considerations of environmental protection, sustainable development and adaptation to climate change;
    2.  meet the obligations of Canada to Indigenous groups, including consultation; and
    3.  align with government security and information management requirements;
7.  increase federal contracting opportunities and access to the overall federal procurement process for Indigenous businesses;
8.  ensure that stakeholder requirements are identified early in the development cycle of any weapon system, platform or service and that they are efficiently and effectively documented;
9.  ensure that effective governance and oversight mechanisms are in place for materiel management;
10.  ensure that tangible materiel and any associated intellectual property are managed together throughout their life cycle;
11.  ensure that the materiel management community has the requisite knowledge, experience and skills to exercise its responsibilities;
12.  ensure that materiel projects:
    1.  are managed in a manner that is consistent with their assessed level of complexity and risk;
    2.  are effectively planned, implemented and controlled to ensure that they are delivered on time, on budget and within scope; and
    3.  use project management methodology based on the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK);
13.  ensure early and continuous industry engagement throughout the procurement process and the utilization period of materiel;
14.  utilize the DND and CAF systems of record for MA&S, and leverage authorized Enterprise Resource Planning software;
15.  ensure that controlled goods are given the level of protection necessary to prevent their unauthorized examination, possession or transfer;
16.  contribute to the financial reporting of materiel through the provision of auditable records that reflect accurate data; and
17.  conclude the disposal of surplus materiel as effectively as possible, as soon as possible after the materiel is declared surplus to the requirements of program delivery.

4\. Consequences
----------------

**General**

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate.
