3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**3.1** The objectives of the DAOD 3002 series for DND and CAF ammunition and explosives (A&E) and the associated A-GG-040-006/AG-001, _Ammunition and Explosives Safety Program_, are to:

1.  avoid, or at least minimize, personnel injury and death;
2.  minimize materiel loss;
3.  contribute to the operational effectiveness of the DND and the CAF; and
4.  meet legislative requirements.

**3.2** The DAOD 3002 series applies to any activity involving A&E if the A&E:

1.  a.is the property of Her Majesty in right of Canada under the direction or control of the Minister of National Defence (MND); or
2.  is deemed to be under the direction or control of the MND.

**3.3** The _Explosives Act_ does not apply to or in respect of any explosives under the direction or control of the MND, except as provided by the _Explosives Regulations_, 2013. Subsection 5(5) of these regulations provides that explosives that are under the control of any armed force cooperating with the CAF are deemed to be under the direction or control of the MND.

**Policy Statement**

**3.4** Due to the inherent dangers associated with A&E, and the potentially grave effects of any accident or incident involving A&E, the DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  establishing policies, orders and directives that:  
    i. meet or exceed the requirements of applicable domestic and international laws; and  
    ii. are compatible with international agreements governing A&E, including those concerning research  
    and development (R&D), acquisition, storage, inspection, maintenance, authorized modification,  
    possession, use and disposal; and
2.  ensuring that DND employees and CAF members are aware of, and strictly adhere to, the laws, policies, orders and directives involving A&E.

**Requirements**

**3.5** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  develop and implement a management program for A&E, including its R&D, acquisition, life cycle management, supporting infrastructure and related accountabilities;
2.  develop, implement and manage the _DND Explosives Safety Program_ to provide occupational safety and accident prevention;
3.  establish conditions for, and restrictions on, the use of A&E, including use on ranges and test facilities;
4.  certify that A&E is safe and suitable for service use;
5.  establish strategic policies and doctrine involving A&E;
6.  establish the conditions, procedures and authorization for the disposal of A&E;
7.  establish emergency response in the event of an incident related to A&E, including the development of an Emergency Response Assistance Plan (ERAP) for the transportation of A&E (see Part 7 of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations); and
8.  establish an A&E risk assessment, acceptance and monitoring process for any situation in which a deviation from a policy, order or directive is either anticipated or being contemplated.

**Note ‚Äì** A&E risk assessments and resulting risk levels are determined in accordance with C-09-005-001/TS-000, _Ammunition and Explosives Safety Manual_, Volume 1, _Program Management and Life Cycle Safety_, Part 3, _Risk Management_.

**3.6** The DAER must notify the DM, CDS, Assistant Deputy Minister (Materiel) (ADM(Mat)) and affected organizations of any non-compliance with this DAOD.

4\. Consequences
----------------

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**4.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the liability of Her Majesty in right of Canada;
