1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2004-07-30

**Date of Last Modification:** 2017-12-05

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Director Ammunition and Explosives Regulation (DAER)

**Enquiries:** Director Ammunition and Explosives Regulation (DAER)

2\. Definitions
---------------

**ammunition** (_munitions_)

Has the same meaning as in DAOD 3002-0, _Ammunition and Explosives_.

**explosive** (_explosif_)

Has the same meaning as in section 2 of the _Explosives Act._

**insensitive munitions** (_munitions à risques atténués_)

Ammunition or explosives which reliably fulfill their performance, readiness and operational requirements on demand and minimize the probability of inadvertent initiation and severity of subsequent collateral damage to weapon platforms, logistic systems and personnel when subjected to selected accidental and combat threats.

3\. Principles for the Use of Insensitive Munitions in the DND and the CF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

**3.1** The DND and the CAF recognize that technological advances in design techniques, manufacture, and storage of ammunition and explosives have made the development of a range of insensitive munitions (IM) possible. Such ammunition and explosives remain effective for their intended applications, but are less sensitive than their predecessors to selected accidental and combat threats such as extreme heat, fire, shock or impact environments.

**3.2** The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has developed standardization agreements (STANAGs) setting out agreed criteria for the development and assessment of IM.

**3.3** NATO STANAG 4439, _Policy for Introduction, Assessment and Testing for Insensitive Munitions (IM)_, has been ratified without reservation by Canada.

**3.4** The DND and the CAF are committed to enhancing safety by ensuring IM are developed and introduced in use in order to:

1.  enhance the survivability of and reduce collateral damage to logistic and tactical combat systems;
2.  minimize accidental personnel injury; and
3.  potentially provide more cost effective and efficient transport, storage and handling.

### IM Assessment Process

**3.5** All ammunition and explosives used by the DND and the CAF, except those described in paragraph 3.8, must be assessed to demonstrate compliance with STANAG 4439 IM requirement goals.

**3.6** The objective of an IM assessment is to determine the level of insensitivity of ammunition or explosives to selected accidental and combat threats, and is referred to as the IM signature. The IM assessment is conducted during the certification process set out in DAOD 3002-1, _Certification of Ammunition and Explosives_.

**3.7** If ammunition and explosives are found to be non-compliant with the minimum IM signature requirements in STANAG 4439 during the validation process set out in DAOD 3002-1, they may still be approved for use by the appropriate level one (L1) advisor in accordance with accepted risk management principles.

### Exemptions from Assessment

**3.8** The following ammunition and explosives are exempt from assessment:

1.  ammunition or explosives in use prior to 2004 and scheduled for replacement prior to 2020; and
2.  ammunition and explosives in Hazard Division 1.4 as set out in the United Nations _Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations_, Volume 1.

### Procurement of New and Replacement Stocks

**3.9** Every opportunity should be taken to introduce IM technology during the:

1.  procurement of new ammunition or explosives stocks; and
2.  replacement of ammunition or explosives stocks prior to the end of their planned service life.

### Reporting Requirement

**3.10** The compliance of DND and CAF ammunition and explosives with STANAG 4439 IM requirement goals must be reported annually.

4\. Responsibilities
