3\. Safety Program
------------------

### Interpretation

**3.1** In this DAOD:

*   "accident" refers to an undesired event or sequence of events, whether or not caused by an ammunition or explosives defect or ammunition or explosive malfunction, in which ammunition or explosive:
    *   are damaged; or    
    *   caused death, injury or environmental or material damage; and
*   "ammunition and explosive occurrence" or "A&E occurrence" refers to an accident, an incident, an ammunition or explosive defect or an ammunition or explosive malfunction; and
*   "incident" refers to:
    *   a theft of ammunition or explosive;
    *   an accidental small arms weapon discharge; or
    *   any other undesired event or sequence of events, whether or not caused by an ammunition or explosive defect or ammunition or explosive malfunction, in which ammunition or explosive had the potential to cause death, injury or environmental or material damage but did not do so.

### Overview

**3.2** Responsibility for ammunition and explosive (A&E) safety rests with the chain of command.

### Ammunition and Explosives Safety Program (AESP)

**3.3** It is DND and CAF policy to maintain an AESP that:

1.  is consistent with the roles and objectives of the DND and the CAF; and
2.  requires participation and support by all DND employees and CAF members who are involved with or responsible for A&E.

**3.4** The AESP is a functional concept combining occupational safety and accident prevention that extends over A&E training, operational and support activities of the DND and the CAF.

**3.5** The AESP must be conducted by DND employees and CAF members in accordance with A-GG-040-006/AG-001, _DND Explosives Safety Program_.

### Aim of the AESP

**3.6** The aim of the AESP is to preserve operational capability by minimizing:

1.  personal injury and death;
2.  materiel damage and losses; and
3.  damage to the environment.

### Application of the AESP

**3.7** The AESP applies to the complete life cycle of all A&E, current or obsolete, Canadian or foreign military in origin, under the direction or control of the Minister of National Defence, under the full range of circumstances in which it is used, including, in particular:

1.  the use of A&E in all sea, land, air and joint operations;
2.  the use of A&E in basic and non-basic individual training and education, and collective training;
3.  research and development relating to A&E;
4.  engineering tests and quality assurance of A&E;
5.  A&E support to other Government of Canada departments and agencies, and provincial and municipal governments;
6.  unexploded explosive ordnance clearance;
7.  explosive ordnance disposal, including improvised explosive device disposal; and
8.  A&E supply chain activities, including procurement, transportation, storage, maintenance and disposal.

### **AESP Participation and Support**

**3.8** DND employees and CAF members who are involved with or responsible for A&E must participate in and support the AESP. Success of the AESP depends on their commitment and understanding of the importance of the AESP in supporting and sustaining safe A&E operations. As such, DND employees and CAF members must be able to report any A&E occurrence or other A&E concern, or propose improvements to current practices, without fear of retribution. See DAOD 3002-4, _Reporting of Ammunition or Explosives Accidents, Incidents, Defects and Malfunctions_, for additional information.

### Related Safety Programs

**3.9** The AESP is one of many specialized DND and CAF safety, accident prevention and health promotion programs that operate within their assigned functional areas. Due to overlapping areas of responsibility, a number of other programs may be affected when an A&E occurrence takes place.

4. **Compliance and Consequences**  

-------------------------------------

### **Compliance**

**4.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**4.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of a level one advisor (L1) or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**4.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note** – In respect to the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
