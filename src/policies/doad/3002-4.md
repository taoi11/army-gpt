2\. Definitions
---------------

**ammunition** (_munition_)

A device charged with explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics, initiating composition or nuclear, biological or chemical material, for use in military operations, and includes a non-charged or inert replica of such a device. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 15923)

**ammunition or explosive defect** (_défectuosité de munition ou d’explosif_)

An ammunition or explosives design deficiency, or a manufacturing defect of, tampering with, or damage to, an ammunition item or explosive, that could or has resulted in less than effective performance. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 42886)

**ammunition or explosive malfunction** (_défaillance de munition ou d’explosif_)

A failure of an ammunition item or explosive to function in an expected or satisfactory manner. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 42889)

**explosive** (_explosif_)

Any thing that is made, manufactured or used to produce an explosion or a detonation or pyrotechnic effect, and includes any thing prescribed to be an explosive by the regulations made under the _Explosives Act_, but does not include gases, organic peroxides or any thing prescribed not to be an explosive by the regulations. (Section 2 of the _Explosives Act_)

**hazardous occurrence** (_situation comportant des risques_)

An event or series of events that results, or has the potential to result, in injury, illness or death, or damage to materiel, real property, immovables or the environment, regardless of the severity of the injury, illness or damage.

3\. Reporting
-------------

### Interpretation  

**3.1** In this DAOD:

*   "accident" refers to an undesired event or sequence of events, whether or not caused by an ammunition or explosive defect or ammunition or explosive malfunction, in which ammunition or explosive:
    *   is damaged; or
    *   caused death, injury or environmental or material damage;
*   "ammunition and explosive occurrence" or "A&E occurrence" refers to an accident, an incident, an ammunition or explosive defect or an ammunition or explosive malfunction; and
*   "incident" refers to:
    *   a theft of ammunition or explosive;
    *   an accidental small arms weapon discharge; or
    *   any other undesired event or sequence of events, whether or not caused by an ammunition or explosive defect or ammunition or explosive malfunction, in which ammunition or explosive had the potential to cause death, injury or environmental or material damage but did not do so.

### Context

**3.2** DAOD 3002-0, _Ammunition and Explosives,_ provides that the DND and the CAF are committed to ensuring that DND employees and CAF members are aware of, and strictly adhere to, the laws, policies, orders, directives and instructions involving ammunitions or explosives (A&E)

### **Purpose**  

**3.3** For the purpose of DAOD 3002-0, DND employees and CAF members who are involved with or responsible for A&E must be aware of and adhere to the procedures for reporting A&E occurrences.

**Note** – An accident or incident as described in this DAOD is also a “hazardous occurrence” for purposes of other DND and CAF safety programs.

**3.4** This DAOD provides direction related to the reporting of A&E occurrences.

### Investigation and Reporting Requirement

**3.5** It is DND and CAF policy that all A&E occurrences must be investigated to determine their causes and reported to make recommendations to prevent recurrence.

**3.6** DND employees and CAF members must report all A&E occurrences in accordance with A-GG-040-006/AG-002, _DND Ammunition or Explosives Accident/Incident/Defect/Malfunction Reporting._ Depending on the circumstances, additional investigation or reporting may also be required. See DAOD 7002-3, _Subjects of Investigation and References_, and DAOD 7026-0, _Administrative Investigations_, for additional information.

### **Multiple Safety Programs**

**3.7** As an A&E occurrence may concern more than one DND or CAF safety program, reporting under one or more safety programs may be required. Reporting to another safety program does not negate the requirement to report under the _Ammunition and Explosives Safety Program_ (AESP). Similarly, the submission of a significant incident report or the conduct of a police investigation, summary investigation or board of inquiry, does not negate the requirement for an AESP investigation.

### **_Ammunition and Explosives Safety Information Management System_**

**3.8** DND employees and CAF members must use the _Ammunition and Explosives Safety Information Management System_ (AESIMS) for the reporting of A&E occurrences. AESIMS is:

1.  a web-enabled tool operating on the Defence Wide Area Network that provides reporting, staffing and analytical functions in support of the AESP; and
2.  a limited-access tool, with defined qualifications for the various roles and associated qualifications set out in A-GG-040-006/AG-002_._

### ****Free and Open Reporting****

**3.9** The information in AESIMS must only be used in support of the AESP. In accordance with A-GG-040-001/AG-001, _General Safety Program_, Volume 1, _Policy and Program_, a hazardous occurrence investigation report, including a report in respect of an A&E occurrence, must not be used for disciplinary purposes. It must be emphasized that to successfully determine causes and contributing factors, investigations must be directed toward fact finding for prevention, not fault finding for punishment. Free and open sharing of critical safety information between managers and military supervisors, and operational personnel, without the threat of punitive action, represents the basis of a healthy safety program. DND employees and CAF members must be able to report A&E occurrences and safety concerns as they arise, without fear of sanction or embarrassment.

**3.10** In providing mandatory reporting under paragraph 3.6, all DND employees and CAF members, and contractors to whom the provisions of this DAOD are applied, are expected to be candid and forthcoming in providing full information. They are expected to voluntarily acknowledge their own errors and omissions, and suggest new or improved preventative measures. Except in a prosecution for perjury or for giving contradictory evidence, any oral, written or recorded statement made by a person reporting an A&E occurrence for purposes of this DAOD, A-GG-040-006/AG-002 or the AESP is not to be used against the person in any administrative or disciplinary action.

### Other Investigations

**3.11** The investigation process under AESIMS is not intended to obtain evidence relating to a potential breach of the Code of Service Discipline or other statutory or regulatory provision, or assign criminal responsibility. If an investigation with such a purpose is to be conducted, the nearest representative of the JAG should be contacted.

4. **Compliance and Consequences**  

-------------------------------------

### **Compliance**

**4.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**4.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of a level one advisor (L1) or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**4.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note** – In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
