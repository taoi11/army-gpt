3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** Materiel sustainment:

1.  represents a significant investment for the Government of Canada;
2.  is an enabler of CAF operational readiness and the most significant part of overall materiel costs; and
3.  is complex and presents opportunities for efficiencies and continuous improvement.

**3.2** The examination of best practices to deliver materiel sustainment has led to a collaborative interdepartmental standardized methodology to develop tailored sustainment solutions. Through joint efforts to optimize materiel sustainment, the interdepartmental aspect of developing sustainment solutions is executed by:

*   the DND and the CAF;
*   Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC); and
*   Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED).

**3.3** ADM(Mat) applies the sustainment business case analysis (SBCA) process in the acquisition of new materiel with a sustainment component, and the sustainment of existing materiel.

### Policy Statement

**3.4** The DND and the CAF are committed to giving equal consideration when applying the following four sustainment principles, and to understanding the consequences of deliberate trade-offs between them, when using the SBCA process to develop a solution for materiel sustainment:

1.  performance ensures materiel that is operationally ready and mission capable;
2.  value for money ensures the required outcomes are procured at a price commensurate with the market rate for comparable procurements;
3.  flexibility allows an adaptable and scalable support system that can readily be adjusted to changes in operational requirements or operating budgets; and
4.  socio-economic benefits leverage economic, environmental, and social policy goals of the Government of Canada from defence procurements for materiel sustainment.

### Requirements

**3.5** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  devise and implement tailored solutions for materiel sustainment within the framework of the DAOD 3000-0, _Materiel Acquisition and Support_;
2.  use the SBCA process when the applicability criteria prescribed in the SBCA Manual are met;
3.  work collaboratively with PSPC, ISED and industry to ensure early and continuous engagement throughout the SBCA process;
4.  seek applicable governance approvals for the sustainment and procurement strategies derived from the SBCA process; and
5.  enter accurate materiel support data into the relevant management systems and preserve any other information necessary to support informed decision-making related to materiel sustainment.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
