3. Policy Direction
-------------------

#### Context

**3.1** DAOD 1000-4, _Policy Framework for Materiel and Asset Management_, assigns functional authority for materiel acquisition and support to ADM(Mat). DAOD 3000-0, _Materiel Acquisition and Support_, requires that the DND and the CAF acquire and support materiel throughout its entire life cycle.

**3.2** The DND and the CAF require reliable defence systems that are available and serviceable to accomplish their assigned tasks. This can be accomplished, in part, by integrated logistics support (ILS). ILS ensures that a defence system:

1.  meets mission requirements of readiness;
2.  maximizes operational capabilities; and
3.  is supported throughout its life cycle by an optimized and cost-effective support system.

**3.3** ILS applies technical and management processes and activities throughout the life cycle of a defence system in order to achieve desired availability, serviceability and reliability at optimum life cycle cost. ILS uses a unified and iterative approach to:

1.  cause support considerations to influence both requirements and design of a defence system;
2.  define the support solution requirements that are optimally related to the design;
3.  design the required support solution;
4.  implement the required support solution; and
5.  monitor and continuously improve the support system over the life cycle of the defence system.

**3.4** Most support systems are a complex range of goods and services provided by the DND and the CAF, other government departments and industry, and these often represent a large percentage of the life cycle cost of a defence system.

**3.5** ILS consists of the following twelve functions, known as ILS elements:

1.  logistics-related operations, i.e. packaging, handling, storage and transportation;
2.  maintenance management;
3.  supply support;
4.  product support management;
5.  computer resources;
6.  technical data;
7.  design influence;
8.  sustaining engineering;
9.  facilities and infrastructure;
10.  training and training support;
11.  human resources and personnel; and
12.  support equipment.

#### **Policy Statement**

**3.6** The DND and the CAF are committed to using ILS to ensure that defence systems are optimized to achieve overall system effectiveness and strategic objectives at an affordable life cycle cost.

#### **Requirements**

**3.7** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  consider a defence system as an integrated system from acquisition to disposal;
2.  apply supportability engineering across the full life cycle of a defence system in order to create and manage a cost-effective support solution that contributes to readiness and effectiveness;
3.  manage an ILS life cycle of activities to implement, manage and sustain a support solution;
4.  optimize the use of the support capabilities and capacities of the DND and the CAF, other government departments and industry;
5.  align the support solution to sustainment principles as defined in DAOD 3005-0, _Materiel Sustainment_, and apply supportability engineering to contribute to the sustainment business case analysis;
6.  conduct ILS activities, integrated with systems engineering and other disciplines, within a system life cycle management framework as set out in DAOD 3033-0, _Systems Engineering_;
7.  ensure that defence systems and equipment are safe, fit for purpose, available and serviceable, and comply with applicable statutes, regulations, policies, instructions and directives as set out in DAOD 3035-0, _Materiel Assurance_;
8.  consider supportability, support system resource needs and life cycle costs in trade-off decisions and contract evaluations;
9.  monitor in-service support solution performance, analyze variances and implement continual improvements in order to meet system effectiveness goals and optimize life cycle cost;
10.  collect sufficient data to enable effective analysis of the performance of the defence system (see DAOD 6500-0, _Data Management and_ _Analytics_ (in draft)); and
11.  ensure that support solutions are verified and validated before:
    1.   introducing a new defence system into service;
    2.   modifying an in-service defence system and technology;
    3.   introducing solutions for in-service failures;
    4.   extending the life of an existing defence system;
    5.   using an existing defence system within either a new application or a new environment; or
    6.   changing the support solution or geographical distribution of a defence system.

4\. Consequences
----------------

#### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
