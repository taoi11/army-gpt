3. **Overview**  

------------------

### General

**3.1** Food safety and food defence are critical to the good health and wellbeing of CAF members. Improper food safety and food defence management can increase the risk of foodborne illness and disease due to unsafe food supplies, food handling or preparation methods. Knowledge of food safety hazards, food safety and food defence practices, modifications to the food supply chain and food production processes can help manage the risk of foodborne illness and disease.

**3.2** All DND employees and CAF members handling food must exercise due diligence at all times to decrease the risk of foodborne illness and disease. To this end, the CAF has adopted a _Food Safety and Food Defence System_ (FSFDS) to achieve force protection. The _Food Safety and Food Defence Pr_o_gram_ (FSFDP) is a component of the FSFDS that focuses on food safety and food defence practices.

4. **Food Safety and Food Defence Management**  

-------------------------------------------------

### **Safe Food for CAF Diners**

**4.1** The DND and the CAF have an obligation under the _Food and Drugs Act_ to provide food that is safe for consumption. CAF Food Services personnel at every level must ensure food is produced and served in a manner which safeguards CAF members and others against foodborne illness and disease. CAF Food Services organizations must implement the FSFDP to ensure these obligations are met.

### **Leadership and Training**

**4.2** The effectiveness of food safety and food defence is proportionate to the level of leadership and support received from commanding officers (COs), other CAF senior officers and DND managers at equivalent levels. COs and DND managers must ensure that their food services personnel are adequately trained in food safety and food defence practices and that these practices are enforced. Appropriate training ensures personnel are cognizant of food safety and food defence practices. Training requirements are set out in the FSFDS.

### **Collaborative Food Safety and Food Defence Communication**

**4.3** Communication of food safety and food defence issues within the DND and the CAF and with organizations external to CAF Food Services is necessary to share knowledge and allow key actors to help in the development of food safety and food defence practices and the continuous improvement of the FSFDS. The FSFDS aims to:

1.  prevent initial food safety and food defence incidents and their reoccurrence;
2.  solve food safety and food defence issues as soon as possible;
3.  provide lessons learned; and
4.  ensure the development of new practices when required.

### **FSFDS Performance and Continuous Improvement**

**4.4** The performance of the FSFDS must be measurable in order to gauge food safety and food defence performance and improve the system as a whole. Continuous improvement is necessary for the FSFDS to remain effective. Managers and military supervisors at every level within CAF Food Services must be able to assess the effectiveness of food safety and food defence practices so they may rectify compliance problems and food safety and food defence issues. The FSFDP provides CAF Food Services organizations with the tools to collect data that can be assessed. FSFDS measurement and assessment may result in changes to food services management and implementation.

5. **Compliance and Consequences**  

-------------------------------------

### **Compliance**

**5.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**5.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of a level one advisor or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**5.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
