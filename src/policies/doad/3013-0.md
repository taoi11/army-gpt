3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**3.1** This DAOD covers the disposal of all “materiel” as defined in subsection 2(1) of the _National Defence Act_. Materiel includes capital assets, inventories, assemblies and sub-assemblies as defined in section 2 of this DAOD.

**3.2** This DAOD should be read in conjunction with relevant Treasury Board and ADM(Mat) policies, instructions, directives, standards and guidance in respect of the disposal of materiel.

**3.3** The two categories of materiel in the Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) dealt with under this DAOD are surplus materiel and end-of-life materiel.

**Exclusion**

**3.4** This DAOD does not provide authority for any declaration of in-service materiel as surplus materiel or as end-of-life materiel simply in order to facilitate a transfer, trade in, sale or donation.

**Policy Statement**

**3.5** The DND and the CAF are committed to carrying out the disposal of materiel as efficiently and effectively as possible in a manner that:

1.  occurs as soon as possible after materiel is declared to be surplus materiel or end-of-life of materiel;
2.  provides the best value for the Crown;
3.  has regard to heritage and public interest considerations;
4.  demonstrates due diligence in complying with all applicable requirements in statutes, regulations, directives and guidelines for controlled goods, hazardous material, protection of the environment, animals, export controls and safety;
5.  demonstrates due diligence in complying with Government of Canada materiel policies implementing international agreements;
6.  ensures completion, prior to disposal, of the appropriate identification of controlled goods, their demilitarization, and the seeking of transfer authorizations and implementation; and
7.  ensures that any live animal being withdrawn from military use is treated ethically and humanely and in accordance with the best interest of both the animal and the Crown.

**Requirements**

**3.6** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  ensure transparency and fairness in the management of the disposal of materiel;
2.  keep records of decisions and approval documents substantiating any disposal of materiel, including auditable records of the costing analyses used for the disposal;
3.  utilize the materiel management system of record for the retention of documents relating to the disposal of materiel and for audit purposes;
4.  protect the integrity of materiel pending disposal action;
5.  dispose of surplus materiel with no warranty as to condition, serviceability or fitness for use;
6.  transfer surplus materiel, when practicable, to a federal government recipient;
7.  have delegation instruments in place that clearly set out DND and CAF authorities and accountabilities for the disposal of materiel;
8.  utilize applicable Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) sales instruments when conducting any sales of surplus materiel in Canada;
9.  attempt the sale of surplus materiel at fair market value in an open and transparent process when conducting sales outside of Canada or in locations too remote for PSPC;
10.  attempt the sale of valuable surplus materiel at fair market value, utilizing applicable PSPC sales instruments;
11.  utilize the following cost minimizing options when the projected costs of a disposal exceed the anticipated proceeds:
    1.  donation to a provincial, territorial or municipal government, a First Nation, other national government or a member of a treaty organization of which Canada is a member, such as the United Nations;
    2.  donation to a recognized charitable or non-profit organization;
    3.  trade in; or
    4.  conversion to waste;
12.  consult with the Assistant Deputy Minister (Policy) (ADM(Pol)) when making a donation of surplus materiel to a charitable or non-profit organization outside of Canada;
13.  offer the right of first refusal of all surplus unclassified personal computers, laptops, servers, monitors, keyboards, mice, printers, modems, hubs, network cards, hard drives and other related hardware to the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada Computers for Schools Program;
14.  generate and retain a Form CF 1303-E, _Declaration of Surplus_, and a Form DND 4001-E, _Disposal Plan_, for materiel declared surplus to requirements, in accordance with A-LM-007-100/AG-001, _Supply Administration Manual_; and
15.  generate and retain a technical instruction for disposal for materiel declared to be end-of-life materiel in accordance with A-LM-007-100/AG-001.

**3.7** The DND and the CAF must not:

1.  donate surplus materiel to an individual or a private sector organization without the written approval of the Treasury Board or an order in council;
2.  donate valuable surplus materiel without the written approval of the Minister of National Defence (MND); or
3.  attempt a sale of surplus materiel at less than fair market value or to a limited market without the written approval of the MND.

4\. Consequences
----------------

**General**

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Failure by the DND and the CAF to ensure that the requirements specified in this DAOD are properly implemented may result in the DND and the CAF not achieving the corporate direction set out in the policy statement. Not achieving this corporate direction could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
