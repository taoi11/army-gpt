4\. Transfer Process
--------------------

### Purpose

**4.1** Under section 2 of the _National Defence Act_, materiel consists of all public property, other than real property, immovables and money, provided for the CAF or for any other purpose under that Act, and includes any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, animal, missile, arms, ammunition, clothing, stores, provisions or equipment.

**4.2** The purpose of this DAOD is to set out conditions and process for the transfer of materiel on a recoverable basis from the DND and the CAF to an OGD.

**Note –** For instructions on the disposal of surplus materiel other than by transfer to an OGD, see DAOD 3013-1 _Disposal of Surplus Materiel_. For information related to the transfer of controlled goods, see DAOD 3003-0, _Controlled Goods_.

### Conditions

**4.3** Materiel may normally be transferred to an OGD only if the materiel:

*   is not immediately needed for general military purposes;
*   can be replaced by the supply chain in sufficient time to satisfy general military requirements;
*   is not readily available to the OGD from other sources, for example, the procurement could be delayed;
*   is unduly expensive if procured by the OGD from some other source; or
*   is required by an OGD to enable it to perform functions formerly carried out by the DND or the CAF.

**4.4** Non-surplus materiel may only be transferred to an OGD on a recoverable basis.

### Referral to DDSAL

**4.5** A DND employee or CAF member receiving a request by an OGD for the transfer of materiel shall refer it without delay to the DDSAL.

### General Transfer Process

**4.6** The following table describes the general process to be followed for the transfer of materiel to an OGD:

| Stage | Description | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Request to transfer materiel | An OGD requesting a transfer of materiel applies using an approved purchase order form. |
| 2 | Determination of the value of the materiel for transfer | The DDSAL determines the value of the materiel for transfer based on the cost to replace the materiel. The cost may be reduced by considering:
*   depreciation; and
*   any required repairs.

 |
| 3 | Receipt of the transferred materiel | The OGD receives the transferred materiel and is required to pay the value determined by the DDSAL, plus any expenses incurred by the DND and the CAF in respect of the transfer, including:

*   special packaging;
*   handling; and
*   transportation.
