4\. Overview
------------

**Context**

**4.1** While CPC has the sole and exclusive privilege under the _Canada Post Corporation Act_ of collecting, transmitting and delivering letters to addressees within Canada, the DND and the CAF have established the CFPS to operate CPC post offices and process CAF mail in support of DND and CAF national and international operations and other activities in accordance with:

1.  the _Canada Post Corporation Act_;
2.  the _Armed Forces Postal Regulations_ and other regulations made under the _Canada Post Corporation Act_;
3.  the _Canada Postal Guide_; and
4.  the _Universal Postal Union_ acts and regulations.

**Movement of CAF Mail**

**4.2** SJS must ensure that CAF mail is moved within and outside Canada in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible.

**Canadian Forces Postal Service**

**4.3** The CFPS is comprised of the following organizations and personnel that oversee all postal matters affecting the DND and the CAF:

1.  Strat J4, as the functional authority for postal policy;
2.  Strat J4 Tn 5, as the technical authority for postal services;
3.  CJOC J4, as the operational authority for postal services; and
4.  CFPU, as the tactical level authority for the support of postal services in Canada and for deployed operations and HMCSs, with:
    1.  three Regional Dets (Eastern (Halifax), Central (Trenton) and Western (Victoria));
    2.  two FMOs for east and west coast naval postal support;
    3.  MPOs for domestic postal support;
    4.  CFPOs; and
    5.  CFPS personnel in the environmental commands.

**4.4** CFPS personnel:

1.  are trained by the Postal Training Cadre of the CFLTC; and
2.  have responsibilities similar to those of CPC employees to enforce the _Canada Post Corporation Act_, its regulations and CPC standards while providing postal services and support to the DND and the CAF.

**4.5** The CFPS is considered an extension of CPC and operates CFPOs and FMOs in accordance with the _Canada Post Corporation Act._

5\. Official and Unofficial Mail
--------------------------------

**General**

**5.1** There are two types of CAF mail moved by the CFPS: official mail and unofficial mail. Official mail must have an official return address authority. Only official mail may be sent at government expense. All CAF mail other than official mail is unofficial mail and moves at the expense of the sender. Unofficial mail includes:

1.  personal letters, parcels and other material;
2.  issued personal military items such as uniforms, boots and berets;
3.  health claims;
4.  resumes;
5.  mess dues and bills;
6.  club, association and kit shop items and newsletters;
7.  donations of charitable goods, other than for the National Defence Workplace Charitable Campaign;
8.  letter events where participation revenues are collected; and
9.  Christmas, sympathy, birthday and other personal cards.

**5.2** Any questions regarding official mail and unofficial mail should be directed to the appropriate channel of communication or chain of command prior to shipping. If purported official mail is found to be unofficial mail, the mail must be returned to the sender.

**Mail Responsibility**

**5.3** Responsibility for the custody, protection and delivery of CAF mail is transferred from CPC

to the DND or CAF upon delivery to an authorized DND or CAF representative.

**Prohibitions**

**5.4** It is prohibited for a DND employee or CAF member to open CAF mail unless expressly authorized by CPC in accordance with the _Canada Post Corporation Act_ or the _Customs Act_.

**5.5** It is prohibited for a DND employee or CAF member responsible for the handling of CAF mail to keep, conceal, delay, detain or abandon it.

6\. International Mail
----------------------

**General**

**6.1** Under the authority of _Canada Post Corporation Act_, the CFPS operates CFPOs in order to provide postal services outside Canada. This permits CAF mail to be sent at domestic rates to Canada instead of having to use the postal services of the host country and international rates.

Eligibility to Use CFPOs

**6.2**  The following are eligible to use CFPOs to send and receive CAF mail:

1.  CAF members; and
2.  Canadian citizens resident outside Canada who are:
    1.  a dependant of a CAF member serving outside Canada;
    2.  a DND employee; or
    3.  a representative of a department of the Government of Canada, the government of a province or territory or a Canadian private agency, providing support in respect of DND and CAF operations or other activities.

**6.3** It is prohibited for a DND employee or CAF member to use a CFPO on behalf of an ineligible person or to conduct a commercial enterprise. Such use jeopardizes international agreements and may result in the loss by the DND employee or CAF member of their right to use CFPOs.

**Postal Services Outside Canada**

**6.4** Two-way postal services can only be provided when a CFPO has been established outside Canada. All CAF mail sent to Canada must bear sufficient Canadian postage at domestic Canadian rates for its delivery to destination using CPC once the mail is customs cleared by the CBSA. CFPOs provide the same range of postal services as CPC retail outlets, including money orders, Xpresspost and stamps. A CFPO must be managed by a qualified postmaster with the rank of at least sergeant.

**6.5** One-way postal services consists only of CAF mail being sent from Canada to DND employees and CAF members serving at locations outside Canada. The local Comd or CO at the location outside Canada must appoint a postal point of contact to liaise with CJOC J4 Post Ops and CFPU for postal matters. As there is no CFPO established, there is no capability to send mail back to Canada using the CFPS.

**6.6** Accordingly, if there is no CFPO established, any mail to be sent from outside Canada must use available means, such as host country postal service, private courier or the postal service of a foreign armed force. The cost to send unofficial mail is an individual responsibility.

**Procedure to Request Postal Services for a CAF Contingent Outside Canada**

**6.7** The following table outlines the procedure to request postal services through CFPS for a CAF contingent outside Canada:

 |

**6.8** When requesting postal services, it is important to take into consideration that:

1.  the CFPS mandate is to provide postal support to deployed operations; and
2.  the CFPS does not have the resources and facilities to significantly expand beyond that mandate.

**Unofficial Mail**

**6.9** Unofficial mail destined to deployed CAF members must be addressed specifically to the individual using the appropriate Belleville address for the contingent located outside Canada or to the appropriate HMCS address. All unofficial mail being sent must conform to CPC regulations and standards and CFPS instructions.

**Customs**

**6.10** International CAF mail, including CAF morale mail, is subject to Canadian customs laws and the laws of both the country of origin and the country of destination.

**6.11** Mail enters Canada only by entry at Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver for appropriate

customs clearance by the CBSA. CAF mail can only be sent to Canada using sustainment flights that terminate in Trenton, Ontario. CFPU personnel must ensure that CAF mail arriving by a sustainment flight in Trenton is sent in bond to Toronto for customs clearance by the CBSA. CAF mail is then sent to destination by CPC.

**Methods of Shipment**

**6.12** CAF mail is forwarded to and from international destinations primarily using available CAF sustainment flights, or commercial couriers and international air mail, as authorized by CJOC J4 Post Ops.
