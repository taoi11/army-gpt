3\. Policy direction
--------------------

### Context  

**3.1** This  DAOD deals with all radio frequency (RF) devices owned or operated by the DND and the CAF that:

1.  operate in the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz; and
2.  are used during training and operations, including research and development activities.

### Policy Statement

**3.2** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  preventing incidents, injuries and losses that may occur as a result of RF radiation exposures; and
2.  planning, implementing and managing activities in the DND and the CAF that create RF radiation within a safety management framework, consistent with applicable practices and standards, to the extent practicable in a military context.

### Requirements

**3.3** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  ensure DND employees, CAF members and members of the public are not exposed to harmful levels of RF radiation and secondary X-rays;
2.  develop and implement a Radio Frequency Safety Program (RFSP) that:
    NaN.  ensures all DND employees, CAF members and contractor personnel at defence establishments, including any vehicle, ship or aircraft, during training and operations, minimize their  RF radiation exposures and that such exposures are within the limits set out in the _Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Energy in the Frequency Range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz_ _– Safety Code 6 (2015) of Health Canada_;
    NaN.  provides guidance to prevent or control hazards associated with RF devices;
    NaN.  includes a process to evaluate and address hazards associated with RF devices; and
    NaN.  ensures RFSP requirements are taken into account during the materiel acquisition and support process; and
    NaN.  ensures the appropriate level of training of DND employees, CAF members and other persons granted access to defence establishments while working with or near RF devices; and
3.  implement a compliance evaluation process to ensure that:
    NaN.  RF devices meet RFSP requirements; and
    NaN.  appropriate physical and administrative hazard controls for RF devices are established.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### General

4.1 Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
