2.  C-55-040-001/TS 002, _Radio Frequency Safety Standards and Requirements_.

### Purpose

**4.2** The purpose of the RFSP is to:

1.  provide the framework upon which L1s, managers of a DND organization, Comds of a command or formation and COs of a unit formulate and implement their own RFS orders, directives and guidance;
2.  prevent incidents, injuries and losses that may occur as a result of RF radiation exposures; and
3.  address RF radiation hazards to personnel, fuel, ammunition, explosives and other materiel, as well as hazards resulting from secondary ionizing radiation emitted by RF devices utilizing high voltages, including:
    NaN.  HERP, HERF and HERO; and
    NaN.  hazards of secondary X-rays

**Note  ̶**  Policy direction in respect of secondary X-rays is also provided by the Director Nuclear Safety.

### RFSP Operational Structure

**4.3** The RFSP operates within the following three-tier structure:

1.  the program authority tier: the COS(Mat), Director General Land Equipment Program Management, QETE Superintendent and RFSP manager;
2.  the TA tier: the QETE Superintendent and RFS TA; and
3.  the operational tier: managers of a DND organization, Comds of a command or formation and COs of a unit that hold or use RF devices.

**Note –** For the respective responsibilities of the office holders in each tier of the RFSP operational structure, see the Responsibility Table.

5. Radio Frequency Safety Program Compliance
--------------------------------------------

### Federal Standards

**5.1** The DND and the CAF must ensure that the RFSP:

1.  complies with the requirements of:
    NaN.  Part II of the Canada Labour Code;
    NaN.  the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations; and
    NaN.  exposure guidelines set out in the Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields in the Frequency Range from 3 KHz to 300 GHz – Safety Code 6 (2015) of Health Canada (hereinafter “Safety Code 6”); and
2.  meets or exceeds standards for RF devices set out in the _Radio Standards Specification 102, Radio Frequency (RF) Exposure Compliance of Radiocommunication Apparatus (All Frequency Bands)_, of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.

**Note  ̶**  The _Canada Labour Code_ and the _Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations_do not apply to CAF members unless they have direct management or supervisory responsibilities in respect of DND employees.

### Materiel Acquisition and Support Process

**5.7** RFSP requirements must be taken into account during the entire materiel acquisition and support process for an RF device.

**5.8** No RF device is exempt from the compliance requirements of the RFSP. If a compliance evaluation has shown that an RF device presents an RF radiation hazard or is capable of causing injury during normal operation, appropriate physical and administrative hazard controls must be put in place in order to maintain exposure within the required limits.

**5.9** In the case of a contract for a new or upgraded RF device:

1.  the contract must provide that:
    NaN.  the contractor is required to provide HERP, HERF and HERO data as applicable; and

2.  the RFS TA must verify compliance.

### The RFSB

**5.10** The RFSB:

1.  reports through the RFSP manager to ADM(Mat) on all RFS-related issues;
2.  may be represented on several safety committees; and
3.  consists of:
    NaN.  a chairperson; and
    NaN.  representatives from each of the following:

RFSP representatives are part of the National OHS Policy Committee, and local RFSP representatives are part of workplace OHS committees. The General Safety Program provides policy direction and guidance to the National OHS Policy Committee and workplace OHS committees.

6. Compliance and consequences
------------------------------

### Compliance

**6.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**6.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**6.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee ;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.
