3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** This DAOD sets out the configuration management (CM) policy for all defence systems managed by the DND and the CAF. CM ensures that:

1.  a known configuration of a defence system is maintained throughout its life cycle;
2.  a defence system remains fit for purpose;
3.  all configuration changes are methodically controlled and documented; and
4.  unnecessary corrective actions, delays, low productivity and unmanageable product evolution are avoided.

**3.2** DND ratified North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4427, _Configuration Management in System Life Cycle Management_. This DAOD aligns the DND and the CAF with the STANAG. Both the STANAG and EIA-649-B, _Configuration Management Standard_, describe the CM process throughout the life cycle of a defence system.

### Policy Statement

**3.3** The DND and the CAF are committed to applying CM throughout the life cycle of a defence system in order to:

1.  properly track and control the configuration; and
2.  optimize both operational and materiel support benefits.

### Requirements

**3.4** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  determine whether the Crown requires the technical data of a defence system for CM purposes;
2.  designate configuration items;
3.  establish a configuration management plan (CMP) during the definition phase of the acquisition of a defence system;
4.  enforce the CMP through each subsequent stage of the life cycle, including the disposal stage;
5.  archive CM records upon disposal of a defence system; and
6.  offer CM training, tools and recommendations for best practices.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
