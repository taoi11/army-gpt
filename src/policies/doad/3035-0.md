3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

#### Context

**3.1** DAOD 1000-4, _Policy Framework for Materiel and Asset Management_, assigns functional authority for materiel assurance to ADM(Mat). DAOD 3000-0, _Materiel Acquisition and Support_, requires the DND and the CAF to implement effective materiel assurance.

**3.2** This DAOD complements, but does not replace, any policies or instructions for which a functional area has been assigned under DAOD 1000-8, _Policy Framework for Safety and Security Management_. See paragraphs 3.2 and 3.4 of DAOD 1000-8 for the functional areas in respect of safety and security management in which policies and instructions may be made. Applicable policy DAOD in these areas are listed in the _[References](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/3000-series/3035/3035-0-materiel-assurance.html#ref)_ section.

**3.3** Responsibility and accountability for the performance of maintenance, maintenance training and risk management of defence systems and equipment are shared between ADM(Mat) and the commanders of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Canadian Army (CA), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC), Military Personnel Command (MPC) and Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM) in accordance with the in-service support solution for each defence system and equipment.

**3.4** ADM(Mat) and operational commanders share the responsibility for materiel assurance throughout the life cycle of materiel.

#### Policy Statement

**3.5** The DND and the CAF are committed to establishing materiel assurance to ensure that defence systems and equipment throughout their life cycle:

1.  are safe;
2.  are fit for purpose;
3.  are available and serviceable; and
4.  comply with applicable statutes, regulations, policies, instructions and directives.

#### Requirements

**3.6** The DND and the CAF must establish materiel assurance that:

1.  assesses and documents safety, fit for purpose, availability and serviceability of defence systems and equipment, and their level of compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, policies, instructions and directives;
2.  includes processes to deliver materiel assurance within enterprise resource planning tools and other systems;
3.  applies a risk management approach;
4.  investigates issues and formulates preventive measures;
5.  ensures that applicable investigative authorities conduct technical investigations if significant defence system or equipment failures or accidents occur;
    
    * * *
    
    **Note** – The Quality Engineering Test Establishment is an investigative authority with the mandate to provide the DND and the CAF with specialized, technology-based test and investigative services required to support engineering decisions throughout all phases of materiel acquisition and support.
    
6.  ensures the acquisition and support of authentic and conforming materiel by:
    1.  preventing counterfeit and non-conforming materiel from entering into the Defence Supply Chain; and
    2.  detecting, quarantining and eliminating counterfeit and non-conforming materiel from inventory;
7.  includes cyber materiel assurance for the delivery of:
    1.  platform protection program;
    2.  systems security engineering discipline; and
    3.  cyber supply chain risk management framework; and
8.  regulates current and future manufacturing technologies.

4\. Consequences
----------------

#### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability
