**primary standards laboratory** (_laboratoire des √©talons primaires_)

A facility that holds primary measurement standards and oversees the calibration hierarchy. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 695754)

**standard** (_√©talon_)

In respect of calibration, a measurement system, instrument, natural physical constant or material with known characteristics and accuracy that is used as a reference to establish and maintain the accuracy of a measurement system, test system or device. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 695755)

**technical authority** (_autorit√© technique_)

3.¬†Policy Direction
-------------------

**Context**

**3.1** The accuracy and reliability of all test, measurement and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) degrade over time. Calibration quantifies and controls errors or uncertainties within the measurement process and ensures that data received from TMDE is converted into an accurate and reliable interpretation of the value.

**Policy Statement**

**3.2** The DND and the CAF are committed to developing and implementing a single Calibration Programme in order to contribute to the operational effectiveness of the DND and the CAF.

**Requirements**

**3.3** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  plan, develop and implement the Calibration Programme within a materiel acquisition and support framework, consistent with applicable practices and standards to the extent practicable in a military context, that:
    1.  ensures the operational effectiveness of platforms, weapons systems and equipment, by complying with the requirements of programmes for naval materiel assurance, land materiel assurance and airworthiness;
    2.  minimizes risks associated with calibration;
    3.  provides calibration services consistent with ISO/IEC:17025-2017, _General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories_;
    4.  ensures calibration and repair services are only performed by authorized facilities; and
    5.  ensures that all calibrations and repairs are traceable to the International System of Units through one of the following:
        *   a national metrology institute;
        *   a primary standards laboratory;
        *   a DND and CAF approved calibration centre;
        *   an original equipment manufacturer (OEM);
        *   an accredited independent laboratory;
        *   an approved source; or
        *   implementation of a compliance and evaluation process to ensure that the requirements of the Calibration Programme are met; and
2.  ensure calibration of TMDE used by the DND and the CAF:
    1.  is subject to technical compliance or technical rigour;
    2.  conforms to specifications established in technical documents;
    3.  is subject to periodic and recurring verification;
    4.  requires verification against a primary measurement standard or a working standard;
    5.  is recommended for calibration by the OEM; and
    6.  is authorized by the calibration authority.

**Exclusions**

**3.4**¬†The calibration of the following are not within the scope of the DAOD 3036 series:

1.  an instrument that is subject to the _Weights and Measures Act_ for the purchase and sale of measured products and services;
2.  radioactivity detection, indication and computation (RADIAC) equipment;
3.  cryptographic and communication security equipment;
4.  a medical device used for patient diagnostics, patient care or patient treatment;
5.  a device used in the enforcement of the Criminal Code or other federal, provincial or territorial laws;
6.  ammunition or explosives;
7.  a tool;
8.  an instrument that is not subject to technical compliance or technical rigour; and
9.  an instrument that:
    1.  does not have a technical authority or a supply manager; and
    2.  is locally procured and not approved by the calibration authority.

4\. Consequences
----------------

**General**

**4.1**¬†Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate.¬†The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
