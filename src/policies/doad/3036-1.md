3\. Operating Principles
------------------------

**Overview**

**3.1** This DAOD sets out the specifications, conditions and standards applicable to the Calibration Programme for the DND and the CAF. The Calibration Programme has been developed to provide calibration services for the DND and the CAF to ensure the operational effectiveness of platforms, weapons systems and equipment, and meet the requirements of naval materiel assurance, land materiel assurance and airworthiness.

**3.2** QETE is responsible for all aspects of the Calibration Programme, including the calibration of approved test, measurement and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) used by level one advisor (L1) organizations. This responsibility is carried out by the calibration authority designated by the QETE Superintendent.

**Calibration Services to External Organizations**

**3.3** Under the Calibration Programme, calibration services may be provided to other government departments and organizations. However, calibration services must not be provided to sustain a recurring industry or private sector need if the provision of services places the DND or the CAF in competition with private industry. See paragraph 23 in B-GS-055-000/AG-001, _Provision of Services_.

**Standards**

**3.4** All calibrations for the DND and the CAF must be traceable to the International System of Units and verified against one of the following standards:

1.  a national standard fixing a value for all like standards and maintained by a national metrology institute (e.g. National Research Council Canada);
2.  a national standard of an agency of a country that is a member of the International Committee for Weights and Measures;
3.  a reference standard used for reference purposes or to transfer a value from a primary standards laboratory to a calibration centre;
4.  a working standard used by a calibration centre primarily to calibrate TDME; or
5.  a user standard used by bases, wings, ships or other units primarily to provide verification of TDME.

**Management of Calibration**

**3.5** Calibration must be performed by trained, competent personnel at facilities authorized to perform calibration services. Authorized facilities may be DND and CAF calibration centres or commercial facilities. Calibrations may be performed on site for TMDE that:

1.  cannot be transported to a calibration centre;
2.  would result in invalid calibration results if transported due to sensitivity of the TDME; or
3.  is more economical to calibrate in location.

**3.6** Under the Calibration Programme, the management of TMDE calibration must be controlled through the Defence Resource Management Information System (DRMIS). DND employees and CAF members responsible for TDME must ensure that TDME:

1.  is certified by the manufacturer and accompanied by a calibration certificate unless otherwise authorized by the calibration authority;
2.  is registered in DRMIS before being placed into service, with materiel management completed in accordance with A-LM-007-100/AG-001, _Supply Administration Manual_;
3.  has a calibration procedure established by a technical authority and approved by the calibration authority in accordance with the technical requirements established by the manufacturer;
4.  has a prescribed calibration interval set by the calibration authority in accordance with its design, operational environment and proven long-term stability, with calibration interval deviations allowed:
    1.  in advance of the calibration expiry date to meet mission support timelines or as deemed necessary for maintenance requirements; and
    2.  for extensions as authorized by the calibration authority based on equipment performance;
5.  is assessed when found to be out of tolerance in order to determine the cause, and reported immediately to the applicable unit calibration coordinator to investigate and report on all products affected in accordance with their own quality assurance programs;
6.  has a record of all calibrations and repairs conducted, with traceability to the International System of Units for audit and investigation purposes;
7.  is calibrated, following repair, prior to return to service; and
8.  is disposed of in accordance with the DAOD 3013-0, _Disposal of Materiel_.

**Repair of TDME**

**3.7** L1 organizations must fund repairs of their TDME and coordinate the repairs with the calibration authority.

4\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

**Compliance**

**4.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**4.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non‑compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non‑compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**4.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect of the _compliance_ of DND employees, see the _Treasury Board Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
