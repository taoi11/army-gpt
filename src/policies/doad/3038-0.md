3. Policy Direction
-------------------

#### Interpretation

**3.1** In this DAOD, “other property” refers to property, other than materiel, real property, immovables or money, that is:

1.  contractor-owned property in government custody or on inward loan; or
2.  referenced in technical documentation requiring the use of materiel master records in order to maintain accurate master data.

#### Context

**3.2** Well-managed and standardized materiel identification (MI), combined with enterprise information management using enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, provides robust governance of materiel and other property, and contributes to the overall operational effectiveness of the DND and the CAF. Effective implementation of MI:

a.      provides correct identification of materiel and other property in the DND and the CAF;

b.     enables unique item identification and interchangeable MI;

c.      supports the capability for analytics;

d.      enhances materiel visibility and contributes to maintaining materiel accountability;

e.     permits the management of, and access to, materiel master records across the DND and the CAF in order to exchange technical, financial, environmental, safety, security classification, provisioning and management information;

f.      facilitates the production and updating of the catalogues of materiel and other property used by the DND and the CAF;

g.     supports materiel standardization and interoperability requirements; and

assists materiel acquisition and support personnel in the performance of materiel management within the Defence Supply Chain.

**3.3** MI does not apply to:

1.   intangible assets, for example, intellectual property rights and records; and
2.   short term rentals, for example, for vehicles, equipment and tools, if such rentals are not part of a defence system.

#### **Policy Statement**

**3.4** The DND and the CAF are committed to carrying out MI in a manner that:

1.   is suitable for all materiel and other property, irrespective of application within the DND and the CAF;
2.   enables:
    1.  clear identification of manufacturing sources and provenance for materiel and other property;
    2.  materiel assurance and configuration management;
    3.  the use of materiel master data, reference data and metadata across enterprise business processes; and
    4.  accurate financial reporting of materiel and other property; and
3.  supports materiel management, master data governance and sound stewardship of materiel master records throughout the materiel life cycle.

#### **Requirements**

**3.5** The DND and the CAF must:

a.     record master data using the Defence Resource Management Information System when security requirements permit;

b.     apply life cycle and configuration management principles with respect to all master data;

c.      comply with data management policies, instructions, directives and guidelines established for the DND and the CAF;

d.     monitor master data quality with appropriate performance metrics;

e.     leverage materiel master records in order to provide audit reporting capability;

f.       enable materiel classification and codification in accordance with the ACodP-1, NATO Manual on Codification, of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);

g.     conduct asset determination in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Administration Manual;

h.     enable the exchange of master data across the DND and the CAF, as well as with other government departments and industry;

i.       maintain alignment and constancy of master data across all ERP-based data records;

j.       maintain digital photographic records of identified materiel and other property, along with relevant technical data and documents;

k.      ensure that the information required to support MI is made available at acquisition and throughout the life cycle of materiel and other property; and

l.       apply required materiel and materiel packaging marks in accordance with the relevant DND policies, instructions, directives and guidelines.

4\. Consequences
----------------

#### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability
