(Section 2 of the _Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act_)

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**3.1** The DND real property portfolio directly supports the operational readiness of the CAF and government-directed programs and activities. Real property life cycle management includes all activities related to planning, acquisition, use, operations and maintenance, and disposal of real property.

**Note –** In this DAOD and related ADM(IE) policies, directives and standards, “real property” in the English versions and “biens immobiliers” in the French versions consists of real property and immovables as these terms are defined in section 2 of the _Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act_.

**3.2** As the single custodian and senior official exercising functional authority for real property, the ADM(IE) is accountable to the Deputy Minister (DM) and responsible for the management of all DND real property in support of the operational readiness of the CAF and government-directed programs and activities. The ADM(IE) manages real property in accordance with defence priorities. Only organizations and personnel authorized by the ADM(IE) may acquire, maintain, improve, upgrade or dispose of real property.

**3.3** In respect of their use of real property in support of the operational readiness of the CAF and government-directed programs and activities, level one (L1) advisors are accountable to the DM or the Chief of the Defence Staff, as applicable.

**3.4** Detailed real property responsibilities for DND employees and CAF members, including L1 advisors and other senior officials, are set out in applicable ADM(IE) policies, directives and standards.

**3.5** This DAOD should be read in conjunction with other related DAODs, policies, directives and standards relating to the environment, aboriginal affairs, ionizing radiation regulations and safety, and fire protection.

**Policy Statement**

**3.6** The DND and the CAF are committed to real property life cycle management in support of the operational readiness of the CAF and government-directed programs and activities in a manner that is consistent with the principles of sustainable development and integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations in real property decision making.

**3.7** The expected result of this DAOD and related policies, directives and standards is the delivery of a real property portfolio that supports CAF operational readiness, contributes to broader government objectives, provides value for money and demonstrates sound stewardship.

**Requirements**

**3.8** In order to implement this DAOD, the DND and the CAF must:

1.  provide responsive decision-making governance structures for the real property portfolio, including authorities and responsibilities, to meet defence priorities;
2.  establish management systems and information systems to plan, manage and assess the real property portfolio and identify all costs related to requirements of the complete real property life cycle;
3.  establish the real property life cycle program in order to ensure the availability of real property;
4.  ensure the timely and cost-effective delivery of real property life cycle management services, including advice; portfolio planning; project development; provision, divestment and disposal of real property; operations and maintenance and repair of real property; operational and technical support; contaminated sites management; treaty review and support; unexploded explosive ordnance legacy sites management; nuclear safety investigations; and promotion, training and awareness;
5.  provide real property performance management through compliance oversight and risk management;
6.  ensure that real property requirements are set out in policies, directives and standards, and that applicable codes and practices are adopted on behalf of the DND and the CAF and are implemented; and
7.  ensure that real property requirements and standards align with environmental and sustainable development requirements, the obligations of Canada to aboriginal groups (including consultation), government security and information management.

4\. Consequences
----------------

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**4.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, including negative impact on CAF operational readiness, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and superiors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 advisor or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a matter under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.
