### Purpose

**3.1** The purpose of this DAOD is to implement the _Fire Protection Standard_ of the Treasury Board in the DND and the CAF, and to ensure that all fires and incidents are properly reported and investigated.

**3.2** Standard reports and investigations enable the DND and the CAF to:

1.  ascertain the causes, origin and circumstances of fires and incidents;
2.  estimate fire and incident losses;
3.  assist in fire prevention efforts; and
4.  compile statistical data.

**3.3** Reporting requirements under this DAOD are in addition to the requirements under QR&O article 21.61, _Investigation of a Fire_, and DAOD 2008-3, _Issue and Crisis Management_.

### Integrated Fire Service Management and Reporting

**3.4** The Integrated Fire Service Management and Reporting (IFSMR) application is used by the CFFM to:

1.  facilitate the electronic transmission and collection of statistical data on fires and incidents; and
2.  record details related to emergency assistance by firefighters.

### Categories of Fires and Incidents Table

**3.5** The following table sets out the six categories of fires and incidents for purposes of this DAOD:

| Category | Any fire or incident ... |

    *   the loss is equal to or greater than $100,000;
    *   a fatality or serious personal injury occurs;
    *   an arson or other criminal act is suspected or known to have occurred;
    *   there is a resulting loss of non-defence property, including the property of a tenant on a defence establishment; or
    *   the fire or incident is expected to create or has created significant media interest.

 |

*   in which the DND or the CAF suffer a public or non-public property loss equal to or greater than $5,000 but less than $100,000.

 |
| 3 |

 |
| 4 | 

*   in which DND and CAF fire fighting resources are involved in providing fire fighting or other emergency assistance for a fire or incident involving non-defence property that is either on or off a defence establishment.

 |
| 5 | 

*   involving any other incident, including:
    *   a false alarm; or
    *   a stand by.

 |
| 6 | 

*   involving a brush or grass fire that would not fall into another category.

4\. Reporting

### Reporting Process Table

**4.1** The following table describes the three steps normally followed when reporting a fire or incident:

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Identification of the category of the fire or incident. |
| 2 | Initial notification of the fire or incident to National Defence Headquarters and CFFM (see the _Initial Notification_ block). |
| 3 | Submission of the detailed report (see the _Follow-on with Detailed Report_ block). |

### Initial Notification

**4.2** A Category 1 fire or incident shall be reported:

1.  as soon as practicable by phone to CFFM 4-6; and
2.  within 12 hours from the start of the response by the IFSMR, facsimile or e-mail to the applicable command and the CFFM during normal working hours, or the Canadian Forces Integrated Command Centre at any other time.

**4.3** A Category 2, 3 or 4 fire or incident shall be reported within three working days by the IFSMR, facsimile or e-mail to the applicable command and the CFFM.

### Initial Notification Format

**4.4** All initial notifications shall use the format provided in the IFSMR. The subject line of initial notifications shall contain the category and a brief description of the fire or incident being reported. The following table describes how the information for submission of initial notifications shall be made if there is no access to the IFSMR:

| Use ... | to submit initial notification for ... |
| --- | --- |
| A | date, time and location of the fire or incident. |
| B | description of property involved. |
| C | causes if known. |
| D | in the case of a fire, probable or known point of origin. |

**4.6** Excluding a Category 5 incident, all completed reports shall be forwarded for signature through the chain of command to the applicable commander of the base or wing, or the commanding officer (CO) of a vessel, unless another signing authority has been designated by the commander or CO. Comments by the commander or CO or other authority in the chain of command not having access to IFSMR shall be inputted by the senior firefighter at the base or wing fire services prior to the report being closed at the local level.

**4.7** All photographic and other evidence in respect of a fire or incident shall be kept at the local level for a period of 10 years.

1.  determine the causes and point of origin;
2.  estimate the property loss;
3.  identify the contributing factors that led to the fire and associated loss;
4.  determine the sequence of events that led to the ignition and spread of the fire;
5.  assess the effectiveness of the fire protection systems that were in place at the time of the fire; and
6.  prepare a report of the investigation.

**5.2** Regardless of whether the fire suppression activities are carried out by the DND and the CAF or an outside agency such as a municipal fire service, all fires involving DND or CAF public or non-public property shall be investigated by either the CFFM or the senior firefighter at the base or wing fire services.

### National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard
