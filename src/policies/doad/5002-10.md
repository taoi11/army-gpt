1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2016-04-28

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members (NCMs) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:**

*   CFAO 11-9, _Commissioning From the Ranks Plan_
*   CFAO 49-10, _Terms of Service – Officers – Primary Reserve,_ Annex C_, Commissioning From the Ranks_

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Personnel Generation Requirements (DPGR)

2\. Overview and Plan Framework
-------------------------------

### Context

**2.1** The CAF provides rewarding career opportunities for NCMs that allow for progression along flexible career paths. The CAF recognizes that some NCMs possess the personal qualities and the potential to serve as officers and provides them with the opportunity to undertake military training in order to develop and progress in an officer military occupation.

### Purpose

**2.2** The Commissioning from the Ranks Plan (CFRP) is an officer production plan that enables the CAF to maintain the optimal trained effective strength and production levels of officers in military occupations by selecting NCMs who possess the military experience and personal qualities required for service as officers and providing them with the military training required for targeted officer military occupations. The CFRP applies to serving NCMs of the Regular Force (Reg F), the Primary Reserve (P Res) and the Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service (COATS). The CFRP operates under distinct parameters for each component or sub-component, as set out in subsequent sections of this DAOD.

**Note –** The CFRP does not apply to NCMs who are serving in the Canadian Rangers or the Supplementary Reserve.

**2.3** The CFRP is not used to effect component or sub-component transfers into the Reg F or the P Res. The CFRP may be used to effect component or sub-component transfers into the COATS.

### CFRP and Officer Military Occupations

**2.4** The CFRP is used to produce officers in officer military occupations that are closely affiliated with specific NCM military occupations. Selection for the CFRP is based on the related experience and demonstrated potential for leadership of the NCM. If a commanding officer (CO) wishes to nominate an NCM for an officer military occupation that is not closely affiliated with the current military occupation of the NCM, the CO must request an entry standard waiver and provide substantiation for the waiver based on the experience or education of the NCM. Waiver requests are submitted through a brigade, base or wing personnel selection officer (PSO).

**2.5** Officers commissioned under the CFRP are exempt from the normal requirement for CAF officers to hold a baccalaureate degree.

**2.6** Within the COATS, NCMs may be commissioned only into the Cadet Instructor Cadre (CIC) military occupation.

### Production Planning

**2.7** The Reg F officer military occupations open to the CFRP are subject to officer production requirements, which are determined by the Annual Military Occupation Review (AMOR) process set out in CAF Military Personnel Instruction (Mil Pers Instr 01/08, _Annual Military Occupation Review (AMOR)_. The CFRP intake requirements are determined by the occupation authorities (OAs) and conveyed in the annual Strategic Intake Plan.

**2.8** For the P Res, a vacant and permanent establishment position must exist for an officer military occupation affiliated with the military occupation of the NCM being nominated.

**2.9** For the COATS, a vacant CIC position must exist.

3\. Selection
-------------

### Role of the CO

**3.1** A CO has a critical role in the CFRP. An NCM must be nominated by their CO as an NCM cannot apply for the CFRP. The onus is on a CO to identify potential nominees and to observe their performance with a view to nomination when the annual competition is announced for the Reg F, or when a position becomes vacant in the P Res or the CIC. If appropriate, COs are encouraged to chair local nomination boards to ensure that only the most highly qualified and deserving nominees are considered.

**3.2** The CO must evaluate each nominee and make a recommendation that assists in determining their officer potential. The recommendation should include substantive comments on the demonstrated officer-like qualities and potential of the nominee to perform as an officer. In the absence of substantive comments from the CO, it may be assumed that the nominee has relatively low potential for service as an officer compared to other nominees whose potential is well substantiated.

### General

**3.3** A CFRP nominee for a:

1.  Reg F competition, must be an NCM currently serving in the Reg F;
2.  P Res officer position, must be an NCM currently serving in the P Res; and
3.  CIC officer position, must be an NCM currently serving in the Reg F, P Res or COATS.

### Eligibility Criteria

**3.4** The following table identifies the standards and requirements that a nominee must meet to be eligible for the CFRP:

### Personnel Records Management

**3.11** An NCM who is promoted under the CFRP must have the designation “CFR” entered under the commissioning plan field (Comm Plan) for purposes of the Human Resources Management System.

4\. Career Administration
-------------------------

**Request for PLAR**

**4.1** In order for a Reg F or P Res CFRP officer to obtain the BMOQ, the unit of the officer must submit a request for PLAR to the Canadian Defence Academy (CDA). In order for a Reg F or P Res CFRP officer to obtain an officer military occupation training equivalency, the unit of the officer must submit a request for PLAR to the OA. In order for a CFRP officer of the COATS to obtain the BMOQ or an officer military occupation training equivalency, the officer must submit a request for PLAR to the RCSU, which forwards it to the DComd Natl CJCR Sp Gp for approval.

**Rank and Promotion**

**4.2** An NCM who has accepted a CFRP offer is not normally eligible for further promotion in their NCM military occupation.

**4.3** A selected nominee is appointed to the rank of officer cadet/naval cadet and transferred to the new officer military occupation prior to the start of military training for the new officer military occupation. Provided that the BMOQ or equivalency has been attained, and the CFRP officer has met the conditions and standards in respect of promotion specified in applicable administrative orders and directives, simultaneous promotion occurs as follows:

a. a CFRP officer who formerly held the substantive rank of sergeant/petty officer, 2nd class or warrant officer/petty officer,1st class is simultaneously promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant/sub-lieutenant; and

b. a CFRP officer who formerly held the substantive rank of master warrant officer/chief petty officer, 2nd class or chief warrant officer/chief petty officer, 1st class is simultaneously promoted to the substantive rank of captain/lieutenant(N).

**4.4** Eligibility for promotion to higher ranks occurs in accordance with officer military occupation specifications and applicable CAF promotion policy.

**Component or Sub-Component Transfer After Commissioning**

**4.5** An officer who has been commissioned under the CFRP may subsequently apply for component or sub-component transfer. Entitlements to rank, time credit for promotion and seniority are determined based on qualifying service as well as military and civilian competencies, in accordance with DAOD 5002-3_._ Entitlements to pay level and pay increment are based on qualifying service and are determined in accordance with CBI 204.015, _Pay Increments._

5\. Training
------------

### Military Training

**5.1** A CFRP officer must undergo military training until qualified in their officer military occupation. Unless a PLAR has been submitted and approved, a CFRP officer of the Reserve Force must make themselves available for required military occupation training. Within the P Res, the CO must:

1.  monitor and ensure that a CFRP officer participates in required military occupation training; and
2.  conduct an administrative review (AR) in accordance with DAOD 5019-2, _Administrative Review_, if the officer fails to participate.

**5.2** If a CFRP officer undergoing military occupation training fails to demonstrate sufficient progress in the training, the CO of the training establishment must:

1.  ensure that the CFRP officer is adequately counselled on areas of weakness sufficiently in advance of the completion of the training to accommodate an improvement; and
2.  if sufficient improvement is not subsequently demonstrated by the CFRP officer, immediately forward a full report to:  
    – the training authority for the officer military occupation, for a Reg F member;  
    – the CO of the member, for a P Res member; or  
    – the DComd Natl CJCR Sp Gp, for a COATS member.

**5.3** The report of failure to demonstrate sufficient progress in training must include a recommendation for the CFRP officer to cease or repeat the training. An AR must be conducted in accordance with DAOD 5019-2. Possible outcomes include:

1.  repetition of the training period;
2.  relinquishment of rank in accordance with QR&O article 11.12, _Relinquishment of Rank_, and subsequent service as an NCM;
3.  component or sub-component transfer as an NCM; or
4.  recommendation for compulsory release from the CAF in accordance with QR&O article 15.01, _Release of Officers and Non-Commissioned Members_.

### Voluntary Withdrawal from Military Training

**5.4** A CFRP officer who decides to cease military occupation training may apply to withdraw from the CFRP and:

1.  relinquish their officer rank in accordance with QR&O article 11.12 for subsequent service as an NCM;
2.  complete a component or sub-component transfer as an NCM; or
3.  request release from the CAF.

**Note –** Return to service as an NCM is subject to service requirements.

**5.5** An application under paragraph 5.4 must be reviewed by the CO of the training establishment. The CO must forward a recommendation for a decision to:

1.  the training authority for the officer military occupation, in the case of a Reg F member;b.
2.  the CO of the member, in the case of a P Res member; or
3.  the DComd Natl CJCR Sp Gp, in the case of a COATS member.

**Note –** For a Reg F or P Res member, a PSO recommendation must be obtained prior to making a decision.

6\. Administration
------------------

### Pay and Allowances

**6.1** The pay and allowances of a CFRP officer are prescribed in CBI Chapter 204, _Pay of Officers and Non-Commissioned Members_, and CBI Chapter 205, _Allowances for Officers and NCMs_, respectively.

7\. Consequences
