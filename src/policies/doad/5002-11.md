1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2016-04-28

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members (NCMs) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:** CFAO 9-70, _Special Commissioning Plan_

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Personnel Generation Requirements (DPGR)

2\. Overview and Plan Framework
-------------------------------

### Context

**2.1** The CAF provides rewarding career opportunities for NCMs that allow for progression along flexible career paths. The CAF recognizes that some NCMs possess the academic requirements, the personal qualities and the potential to serve as officers and provides them with the opportunity to apply to undertake the military training required in order to develop and progress in an officer military occupation.

### Purpose

**2.2** The Special Commissioning Plan (SCP) is an officer production plan that enables the CAF to maintain the optimal trained effective strength and production levels of officers in military occupations by providing selected NCMs with the military training required for targeted officer military occupations. The SCP applies to serving NCMs of the Regular Force (Reg F) and the Primary Reserve (P Res), who possess an academic degree suitable for targeted officer military occupations and who have demonstrated performance and personal qualities indicative of officer potential. Eligibility for the SCP is generally the same for both the Reg F and the P Res, but the selection process differs, as set out in section 3 of this DAOD.

**2.3** The SCP is not used to effect component or sub-component transfers.

### Production Planning

**2.4** The Reg F officer military occupations open to the SCP are subject to officer production requirements, which are determined by the Annual Military Occupation Review (AMOR) process set out in CAF Mil Pers Instr 01/08, _Annual Military Occupation Review (AMOR)_. The SCP intake requirements are determined by the occupation authorities (OAs) and conveyed in the annual Strategic Intake Plan.

**2.5** For the P Res, a vacant and permanent establishment position must exist for an officer military occupation.

3\. Selection
-------------

### General

**3.1** An applicant for the SCP must be an NCM currently serving:

1.  in the Reg F in order to apply for a Reg F competition; or
2.  in the P Res in order to apply for a vacant position in the P Res.

### Eligibility Criteria

**3.2** The following table identifies the standards and requirements that an applicant of the Reg F or the P Res must meet to be eligible for the SCP:

| An applicant must … | Amplification |
| --- | --- |

 | 

*   N/A.

 |
| 

*   have attained the operationally functional point in their currently assigned military occupation.

 | 

*   The “operationally functional point” is that point in the training progression of a CAF member when the CAF member has completed all qualifications required for first employment in their military occupation and is considered trained to an “operationally functional” level. The operationally functional point for each military occupation is set out in the military occupation specifications.

 |

**Note** **–** An NCM who meets all eligibility criteria may apply for one or more officer military occupations.

### Time Remaining to Serve

**3.3** An applicant of the Reg F must be able to serve, as of the effective date of transfer to the targeted military occupation, at least the number of years equal to the length of the variable initial engagement (VIE) specified for a direct entry officer (DEO) in that military occupation, as set out in ADM(HR-Mil) Instr 05/05, _The New CF Regular Force Terms of Service_, Annex A, Appendix 1 or any successor instrument. A selected Reg F applicant may be required to sign further terms of service (TOS) in accordance with the TOS sequence for the new officer military occupation.

**3.4** An applicant of the P Res must be able to serve, as of the effective date of transfer to the targeted military occupation, at least two years or such longer period as a promotion authority may specify to permit employing the SCP officer upon completion of required military occupation training.

### Academic Requirements

**3.5** An applicant is required to possess an acceptable academic degree identified as the entry level requirement for the targeted officer military occupation, as stipulated in the entry standards for the officer military occupation. The academic degree must be from a Canadian university, college or other educational institution that has degree-granting authority accredited by a provincial or territorial ministry or a federal government department, or be a recognized degree from a foreign university or educational institution that has been evaluated as the equivalent of a Canadian degree.

### Applicant Not Selected

**3.8** If an applicant is not selected for the SCP but would like to apply again, the application process must be repeated for consideration for a subsequent competition for the Reg F or vacant position for the P Res, as applicable.

### Role of the CO in Selection Process

**3.9** The CO has an important role in the selection process. The CO evaluates the officer potential of each applicant and makes a recommendation that assists in determining officer potential. The recommendation should include substantive comments on the demonstrated officer-like qualities and potential of the applicant to perform as an officer. In the absence of substantive comments from the CO, it may be assumed that the applicant has relatively low potential for service as an officer compared to other applicants whose potential is well substantiated.

### Right to Apply

**3.10** If a position is available in a targeted officer military occupation, an NCM who meets all of the eligibility criteria has the right to submit an application for the SCP. If the CO or the PSO does not support the application, this should be clearly stated in the recommendation. However, the application of an NCM who meets the eligibility requirements must be forwarded to the selection authority unless withdrawn by the applicant.

### Distinctive Environmental Uniform (DEU)

**3.11** The DEU is confirmed upon selection for the SCP. An SCP officer normally retains the DEU of their former military occupation. If that uniform is not permitted within the targeted officer military occupation, a new DEU that matches the identity of the newly assigned officer military occupation (see A-DH-265-000/AG-001, _Canadian Forces Dress Instructions_) must be issued prior to the start of training.

### Personnel Records Management

**3.12** An applicant who is promoted under the SCP must have the designation “Spec Com” entered under the commissioning plan field (Comm Plan) for purposes of the Human Resources Management System.

4\. Career Administration
-------------------------

### Request for Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR)  

**4.1** In order for an SCP officer to receive the BMOQ based on any equivalency already completed, the unit of the officer must submit a request for PLAR to the Canadian Defence Academy (CDA). In order for an SCP officer to receive any eligible military occupation training equivalency, if applicable, the unit of the officer must submit a request for PLAR to the OA for the officer military occupation.

### Rank and Promotion

**4.2** An NCM who has accepted an SCP offer is not normally eligible for further promotion in their NCM military occupation.

**4.3** To be eligible for any promotion, an SCP officer must meet the conditions and standards in respect of promotion specified in applicable administrative orders and directives.

**4.4** A selected applicant is appointed to the rank of officer cadet/naval cadet and transferred to the new officer military occupation prior to the start of any military training for the new officer military occupation.

**4.5** The rank of officer cadet/naval cadet is held until the date that the BMOQ is attained or an equivalency is granted, upon which the SCP officer becomes eligible for promotion to the substantive rank of second lieutenant/acting sub-lieutenant. An SCP officer whose former rank immediately prior to accepting an offer under the SCP was sergeant/petty officer 2nd class or higher is simultaneously promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant/sub-lieutenant. Simultaneous promotion to the substantive rank of lieutenant/sub-lieutenant also occurs for an SCP officer in an officer military occupation for which the applicant’s academic degree satisfies the requirements for promotion to that rank as stated in the officer military occupation specifications.

**4.6** Eligibility for promotion to higher ranks occurs in accordance with officer military occupation specifications and applicable administrative orders and directives.

### Component or Sub-Component Transfer After Commissioning

**4.7** An officer who has been commissioned under the SCP may apply for component or sub-component transfer. Entitlements to rank, time credit for promotion and seniority are determined based on qualifying service as well as military and civilian competencies, in accordance with DAOD 5002-3, _Component and Sub-Component Transfer_. Entitlements to pay level and pay increment are based on qualifying service and are determined in accordance with CBI 204.015, Pay Increments.

5\. Training
------------

### Military Training

**5.1** An SCP officer must undergo military training until qualified in their officer military occupation. Within the P Res, the CO must:

1.  monitor and ensure that an SCP officer participates in required military occupation training; and
2.  conduct an administrative review (AR) in accordance with DAOD 5019-2, _Administrative Review_, if the officer fails to participate.

**5.2** If an SCP officer undergoing military training fails to demonstrate sufficient progress in the training, the CO of the training establishment must:

1.  ensure that the SCP officer is adequately counselled on areas of weakness sufficiently in advance of the completion of the training to accommodate an improvement; and
2.  if sufficient improvement is not subsequently demonstrated by the SCP officer, immediately forward a full report to:  
    – the training authority for the officer military occupation, for a Reg F member; or  
    – the CO of the member, for a P Res member.

**5.3** The report of failure to demonstrate sufficient progress in training must include a recommendation for the SCP officer to cease or repeat the training. An AR must be conducted in accordance with DAOD 5019-2. Possible outcomes include:

1.  repetition of the training period;
2.  transfer to another officer military occupation;
3.  relinquishment of rank in accordance with QR&O article 11.12, _Relinquishment of Rank_, and subsequent service as an NCM;
4.  component or sub-component transfer; or
5.  recommendation for compulsory release from the CAF in accordance with QR&O article 15.01, _Release of Officers and Non-Commissioned Members_.

### Voluntary Withdrawal from Military Training

**5.4** An SCP officer who decides to cease military occupation training may apply to withdraw from the SCP and:

1.  transfer to another officer military occupation;
2.  relinquish their officer rank in accordance with QR&O article 11.12 for subsequent service as an NCM;
3.  complete a component or sub-component transfer; or
4.  request release from the CAF.

**_Note_** **–** Transfer to another officer military occupation or return to service as an NCM is subject to service requirements.

**5.5** An application under paragraph 5.4 must be reviewed by the CO of the training establishment. The CO must forward a recommendation for a decision to:

1.  the training authority for the officer military occupation, in the case of a Reg F member; or
2.  the CO of the member, in the case of a P Res member.

**_Note_ –** A PSO recommendation must be obtained prior to making a decision.

6\. Administration
------------------

### Pay and Allowances

**6.1** The pay and allowances of an SCP officer are prescribed in CBI Chapter 204, _Pay of Officers and Non-Commissioned Members_, and Chapter 205, _Allowances for Officers and NCMs_, respectively.

7\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**7.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for the CAF as an institution and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance may be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.
