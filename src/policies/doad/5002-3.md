1.  rank, pay increments, incentive credit, time credit for promotion and seniority are determined based on qualifying service, as well as military and civilian competencies;
2.  Reserve Service is counted as pensionable service for purposes of the _Canadian Forces Superannuation Act_ as follows:
    1.  100% of Class B and C Reserve Service; and
