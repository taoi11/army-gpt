1\. Idenification
-----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2011-07-18

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members (NCM) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:** CF Military Personnel Instructions 01/03, _Personnel Selection Officers_

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Personnel Generation Requirements (DPGR)

2\. CF Personnel Selection System
---------------------------------

### Context

**2.1** The CF Personnel Selection System (CFPSS) is an essential component of the military personnel management system. The CFPSS consists of a set of personnel selection elements, including the CF Selection Model (CFSM), scientific research, policies, directives, and recruiting and in-service selection production processes. The CFPSS reflects progressive concepts based on research and best practices in industrial and organizational psychology. The CFPSS is continuously monitored and reviewed, and may be modified as a result of selection research and analysis.

**2.2** As the CFPSS is decentralized, it allows for lower cost in the performance of personnel selection functions, but requires a network of DND employees and CAF members normally employed exclusively in positions to support its functions and to ensure transparency and equity in its application.

**2.3** The CFPSS is supported by a selection research programme that ensures that the CFPSS is valid, reliable, legally defensible and compliant with professional and ethical standards.

### Purpose

**2.4** The CFPSS:

1.  assists in the selection of the best candidates to meet force structure requirements;
2.  ensures optimal employment fit of a candidate within the target environment and military occupation;
3.  contributes to the satisfaction of the career aspirations of individual CAF members; and
4.  enhances the organizational effectiveness of the CAF.

### CFPSS Application

**2.5** The CFPSS is applied for the purpose of selecting applicants and CAF members for:

1.  basic military training;
2.  basic military occupation training;
3.  initial employment;
4.  advanced training and subsidized education;
5.  occupation and component or sub-component transfer;
6.  promotion and commissioning; and
7.  special military employment.

**2.6** The selection of applicants and CAF members under the CFPSS requires:

1.  a job analysis process to identify the knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics required for successful performance in basic military training, military occupation training, advanced training and special military employment; and
2.  the application of selection tests, measures and evaluation methods developed from the job analysis process.

### Personnel Selection Authorities

**2.7** The following table identifies the authorities associated with personnel selection:

| The … | is the … |
| --- | --- |
| CMP | functional authority for personnel selection. |
| Director General Military Personnel Research and Analysis (DGMPRA) | scientific authority for personnel selection research. |
| DPGR | policy authority for personnel selection development, advice and support. |
| DPGR 4 | technical authority for the personnel selection process and practice. |

3\. CF Selection Model
----------------------

### General

**3.1** The CFSM:

1.  is comprised of elements that are recognized in selection research as strong predictors of success in military training, work performance and special military employment; and
2.  provides empirical support for the use and development of selection procedures.

**3.2** Applicants and CAF members are selected using tests, measures and procedures that are research evidence-based.

### CFSM Management

**3.3** The DPGR 4 shall:

1.  develop, maintain and control the application of the CFSM, including the conduct of audits; and
2.  assess the requirement for, and issue, directives that are research evidence-based, to ensure the effectiveness of the CFSM for recruiting and in-service selection (see the DPGR intranet site for applicable DPGR 4 directives).

**3.4** The following table sets out elements of the CFSM:

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| General cognitive ability testing | General cognitive ability is measured by the CF Aptitude Test (CFAT). The CFAT is a timed test composed of multiple items that measure verbal skills, spatial ability and problem-solving.The CFAT result is a factor used to determine eligibility for the CAF and military occupations.
 |
| Personality testing | Personality testing measures and describes the traits of a person. Personality testing results are used to ensure that the applicant or CAF member possesses the traits required to succeed in the CAF, in a targeted military occupation, on advanced training or in special military employment. |
| Person-job fit measure | Person-job fit refers to the match between a person and a job. Person-job fit can be measured with, but is not limited to, any combination of the following factors that are related to predicting the success of the applicant or CAF member within the target environment and military occupation:

*   skills;
*   experiences;
*   education;
*   training;
*   occupation knowledge;
*   motivation; and
*   biographical data (also referred to as "biodata").

 |
| Selection methodologies | Selection methodologies implemented to assess components of the CFSM vary and may include:

*   psychological testing, administered by paper and pencil or electronic technologies, that measure knowledge, skills, abilities and aptitudes;
*   interviews;
*   situational exercises, which may include role plays; and
*   the assessment centre method.

 |
| Other psychological testing and measures | Other psychological testing and measures to assess knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics, as identified by the job analysis process. |

### Assessment Centre Method

**3.5** The assessment centre method is a standardized selection procedure using multiple selection methodologies and trained assessors to evaluate candidates for a military occupation, advanced training or special military employment.

**3.6** The assessment centre method:

1.  may vary in length but normally lasts no more than three days; and
2.  is implemented by career field and occupation authorities (see CF Military Personnel Instructions 02/07, _Authority and Management Framework – Military Employment Structure (MES))_.

**3.7** Career field and occupation authorities shall:

1.  obtain the permission of the DPGR 4 on each occasion to develop or implement the assessment centre method;
2.  be responsible for the application of selection methodologies, assessors, assessor training, working conditions and schedules;
3.  provide resources and equipment to support the assessment centre method; and
4.  evaluate, upon completion of the use of the assessment centre method, the effectiveness of the method and provide the DPGR 4 with feedback.

**3.8** The DPGR 4 shall collaborate with the DGMPRA and career field and occupation authorities, and provide oversight on the implementation of the assessment centre method.

### Management and Control of Psychological Testing

**3.9** The DPGR 4 shall:

1.  manage and control the psychological test materials used for the purpose of selection; and
2.  issue directives to those persons applying the CFSM that include, as a minimum, procedures for:
    1.  procuring testing materials;
    2.  securing testing materials;
    3.  ensuring accountability;
    4.  maintaining quality control;
    5.  protecting testing information and results;
    6.  reproducing testing materials;
    7.  destroying testing materials; and
    8.  attaining testing certification.

### Selection Research and Application

**3.10** Selection research that may affect the CFSM, including the validation of selection tests, methods or cut-off scores, shall be conducted by DGMPRA on behalf of the CMP, career field and occupation authorities, and other level one advisors.

**3.11** The DGMPRA shall:

1.  plan, coordinate, conduct and provide analysis on selection research, including, but not limited to:
    
    2.  analyses to ensure the validity and reliability of the CFSM and individual selection tests and measures using data from military occupation training at training establishments; and

2.  identify, design and trial selection testing, measures and procedures for recruiting and in-service selection in conjunction with the DPGR, Canadian Forces Recruiting Group (CFRG), Director General Military Careers (DGMC) and environmental chiefs of staff;
3.  conduct strategic research to identify new technologies, methodologies and psychological constructs that could improve selection decisions;
4.  determine, upon request by CAF stakeholders (e.g. environmental chiefs of staff, other level one advisors, career field and occupation authorities, and level two advisors), if selection strategies are an effective means of solving identified personnel problems related to issues such as training or attrition; and
5.  forward all selection research recommendations and reports to the Director General Military Personnel (DGMP) for action and to the DPGR 4 for information.

**3.12** On receipt of selection research recommendations and reports, the DGMP shall:

1.  review the research recommendations and reports;
