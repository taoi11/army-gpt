1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2011-11-09

**Date of Last Modification**: 2018-04-23

**Application**: This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (“CAF members”).

**Supersession:**

*   CANFORGEN 156/05, _Continuing Education Officer Training Plan – (CEOTP)_
*   CANFORGEN 053/12, _CEOTP – Air Environmental Affiliated Degree - Pilot_
*   CANFORGEN 141/13_, CEOTP –Degree Attainment Serving Engineer/Signals Officers_
*   CANFORGEN 030/14, _CEOTP – Addition Preferred and Environmental Affiliation Degrees_
*   CF Military Personnel Instructions 09/05, _Continuing Education Officer Training Plan_

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Personnel Generation Requirements (DPGR)

2\. General Principles
----------------------

**Context**

**2.1** The CAF recognizes that the attainment of a baccalaureate degree:

*   fulfills part of the professional development requirements for officers; and
*   enables officers to develop their leadership abilities to the required standard.

**2.2** Normally, a baccalaureate degree is a prerequisite to the enrolment of an officer applicant or for the promotion of an officer cadet/naval cadet to a commissioned rank, however under certain conditions it may be necessary for the CAF to accept applicants or to promote CAF members who lack a baccalaureate degree but who are otherwise suitable for employment as an officer.

**2.3** A suitable applicant or CAF member who lacks a baccalaureate degree may become an officer under the Continuing Education Officer Training Plan (CEOTP) provided that they attain a baccalaureate degree prior to the completion of their variable initial engagement (VIE) or current terms of service.

**Purpose**

**2.4** The CEOTP is a Regular Force officer production plan that enables the CAF to maintain the occupational health of officer military occupations. It supplements officer production in under-strength officer military occupations with applicants or CAF members, who are required to attain a baccalaureate degree suitable for the targeted officer military occupation prior to the completion of their VIE and any period of service requiring a waiver of right to release.

**Production Criteria**

**2.5** The CEOTP is normally used when:

*   shortages in an under-strength officer military occupation adversely affect service requirements; and
*   recovery of the officer military occupation cannot be satisfied through the other officer production means (i.e. Regular Officer Training Plan, Direct Entry Officer Plan, and in-service commissioning and promotion plans).

**2.6** An under-strength officer military occupation is one in which the:

*   trained effective strength is equal to or less than 95% of its maximum authorized strength; and
*   untrained effective strength in the officer military occupation is insufficient to fill the gap between the trained effective strength and the maximum authorized strength within a two-year period.

**2.7** The CEOTP may also be used when an officer military occupation exceeds 95% of the maximum authorized strength but the intake requirement is limited to 20% of the annual production requirement for the officer military occupation.

**The CEOTP and Officer Military Occupations**

**2.8** The CEOTP:

*   is normally used to produce general service officers (GSOs) in officer military occupations managed by occupation authorities as set out in _DAOD 5070-1 Military Employment_ Structure (_MES_) _Framework_ that have requirements stipulated in the military occupation Entry Standards (ES), for example, a specific type of university degree (e.g., a baccalaureate degree in science) or professional certification, licensing or registration with a regulatory body (e.g., registered nurse) provided that the requirements for that officer military occupation can be attained using the educational assistance options provided for in the CEOTP.

Note – Officer military occupation ESs are available on the DPGR intranet site.

**2.9** The CEOTP may not be used to produce the following specialist officers in officer military occupations: legal officers, medical officers and chaplains.

**Production Planning**

**2.10** The officer military occupations open to the CEOTP are subject to officer production requirements which are determined by the Annual Military Occupation Review (AMOR) process as set out in CF Military Personnel Instruction 01/08, _Annual Military Occupation Review (AMOR)._

**2.11** The CEOTP officer intake requirements are:

*   determined by the career field and occupation authorities; and
*   conveyed in the annual Strategic Intake Plan (SIP).

6. Compliance and Consequences
------------------------------

**Compliance**

**6.1** CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, CAF members may seek direction through their CoC. Military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of CAF members with this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**6.2** CAF members are accountable to their military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the CAF as an institution, and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**6.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
8.  the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada and CAF members.
