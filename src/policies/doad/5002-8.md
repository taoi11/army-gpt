1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2015-02-24

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members (NCMs) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:**

*   CFAO 9-46, _Reserve Entry Scheme – Officers_
*   CFAO 49-10, _Terms of Service – Officers – Primary Reserve_, Annex A, Appendix 3, Serial 7
*   CANFORGEN 023/13, _Reserve Entry Scheme – Officers (RESO)_

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Personnel Generation Requirements (DPGR)

2\. Overview and Plan Framework
-------------------------------

### Context

**2.1** The CAF recognizes that the attainment of a baccalaureate degree:

1.  fulfils part of the professional development requirements for officers; and
2.  assists officers in the development of their leadership abilities to the required standard.

**2.2** A baccalaureate degree is normally a prerequisite for the enrolment of an officer applicant or the promotion of an officer cadet/naval cadet to a commissioned officer rank. However, under certain conditions it is necessary for the CAF to accept applicants or promote CAF members who lack a baccalaureate degree but who are otherwise suitable for employment as an officer.

**2.3** A suitable civilian or CAF member who lacks a baccalaureate degree may apply to become a Primary Reserve (P Res) officer under the Reserve Entry Scheme – Officers (RESO).

### Purpose

**2.4** The RESO is a P Res officer production plan. It enables the CAF to maintain the optimal trained effective strength and production levels of P Res officers in military occupations by enrolling civilians, or promoting or transferring CAF members, who are required to attain a baccalaureate degree suitable for the targeted officer military occupation prior to being promoted to the rank of major/lieutenant-commander.

**2.5** In accordance with officer military occupation entry standards, the RESO may also be used to enrol specialist officers who are pursuing an advanced degree programme specified as the requirement for entry into the targeted officer military occupation.

**Note –** Officer military occupation entry standards are available on the DPGR intranet site.

### RESO and Health Services Officer Military Occupations

**2.6** Despite the flexibility inherent in this DAOD, all RESO applicants to health services officer military occupations, with the exception of health care administration, must be enrolled in full-time studies leading to the required academic degree for the officer military occupation.

### RESO and the Chaplain Branch

**2.7** Given the unique military occupation requirements, details of the RESO as it applies to the Chaplain Branch are set out in Canadian Forces Military Personnel Instruction (CAF Mil Pers Instr) 01/15, _Reserve Entry Scheme – Officers, Chaplain Branch_.

### RESO Planning and Management

**2.8** In order to select a civilian or CAF member as a RESO officer, a vacant establishment position must be available.

3\. Selection
-------------

1.  a civilian with or without prior CAF service;
2.  a P Res NCM;
3.  a Regular Force (Reg F) officer or NCM on component transfer; or
4.  an officer or an NCM from another Reserve Force (Res F) sub-component on sub-component transfer.

**Note –** While civilians are not subject to DAODs as directives or orders, this DAOD sets out the administrative process applicable to civilians entering the RESO.

**3.2** An applicant who holds an academic degree that is not acceptable for the targeted officer military occupation as set out in the officer military occupation entry standards may also be enrolled under the RESO.

### Eligibility Criteria

1.  the Royal Military College of Canada;
2.  a Canadian university accredited by a provincial or territorial ministry or a federal government department;
3.  a Canadian college or educational institution that has degree-granting authority accredited by a provincial or territorial ministry or a federal government department; or
4.  any other degree-granting institution that has been accredited by a Canadian accrediting authority as having education standards and curriculum comparable to a Canadian university or college with degree-granting authority. It is the responsibility of the RESO officer to provide proof of accreditation by a Canadian accrediting authority.

### Academic Degrees

**5.2** In accordance with the entry standards published on the DPGR intranet site, a RESO officer is required to complete an academic degree appropriate to the assigned officer military occupation.

**5.3** A RESO officer may be awarded academic credits by their educational institution for academic credits obtained at other educational institutions and through military training. It is the responsibility of the RESO officer to initiate a PLAR process with their educational institution.

### Learning Plans

**5.4** An applicant for the RESO is required to provide their CO with a written plan for completion of their academic degree. This may be a copy of the ILP filed with the CDA (see paragraph 7.4).

### Changes to Learning Plans

**5.5** A RESO officer is permitted to schedule one or more breaks from their academic training, subject to the policies of the educational institution in which the RESO officer is enrolled. Such breaks may be for service reasons such as a deployment, or for personal reasons. For any such break, a RESO officer is required to:

1.  advise their CO of:
    1.  their intention to schedule the break; and
    2.  their plan for resuming their studies; and
2.  revise their ILP.

**5.6** Except as provided in paragraph 2.6, a RESO officer is permitted, subject to the policies of the educational institution in which the officer is enrolled, to change their academic programme from full-time to part-time studies. In such a case, the RESO officer is required to:

1.  advise their CO of any changes to their learning plan; and
2.  revise their ILP.

**5.7** A RESO officer should request approval from their CO prior to changing their academic degree programme to a different degree programme. Prior to approving any change to the academic degree programme, the CO must ensure that the new academic degree satisfies the requirements of the military occupation of the officer. This may be done by consulting the officer military occupation entry standards or the brigade, base or wing PSO. If a RESO officer changes their academic degree programme to one which is unacceptable for their officer military occupation, the CO must conduct an administrative review (AR) in accordance with DAOD 5019-2, _Administrative Review_, and CANFORGEN 134/12, _Decentralization of Authorities Related to Remedial Measures and Administrative Actions_. Possible actions as a result of the AR include:

1.  military occupation transfer to another officer military occupation for which the academic degree is acceptable;
2.  relinquishment of rank in accordance with QR&O 11.12, _Relinquishment of Rank_, and service as an NCM; or
3.  release.

### Monitoring Academic Progress

**5.8** The academic progress of RESO officers must be monitored by unit COs and reported on using the CF Personnel Appraisal System (CFPAS).

**5.9** If a RESO officer fails to make academic progress in a manner consistent with their learning plan or does not maintain acceptable standing as defined by their educational institution, the RESO officer must notify their CO. The CO must interview the officer to determine:

1.  reasons for the lack of progress;
2.  whether modifications to the learning plan are possible to allow the officer to complete the academic degree or another degree suitable for the officer’s military occupation; and
3.  a course of action, including the use of remedial measures in accordance with DAOD 5019-4, _Remedial Measures_.

**5.10** If a RESO officer withdraws from their academic programme or is unwilling or unable to complete an academic degree, the CO must conduct an AR in accordance with DAOD 5019-2 and CANFORGEN 134/12. Possible actions as a result of the AR include:

1.  retention with restriction in rank if permitted by the requirements of the officer’s military occupation;
2.  military occupation transfer to another officer military occupation, with restriction in rank, if an academic degree is not part of the requirements of that officer military occupation;
3.  relinquishment of rank in accordance with QR&O 11.12 and service as an NCM; or
4.  release.

6\. Military Occupation Training and Duty
-----------------------------------------

### Military Occupation Training

**6.1** Military occupation training for a RESO officer takes place at the P Res unit of the officer, at other units assigned by their CO, or at CAF training establishments during the summer training period or at other times depending on availability of the training. Until qualified in their officer military occupation, a RESO officer is expected to attend military occupation training, including that which is provided at CAF training establishments.

**6.2** If a RESO officer is not progressing satisfactorily in military occupation training, the CO must interview the RESO officer with a view to facilitating progress. The CO may also consider the use of remedial measures in accordance with DAOD 5019-4. If, after being given a reasonable opportunity, the RESO officer fails to improve adequately, the CO must conduct an AR in accordance with DAOD 5019-2 and CANFORGEN 134/12. Possible actions as a result of the AR include:

1.  military occupation transfer;
2.  relinquishment of rank in accordance with QR&O 11.12 and service as an NCM; or
3.  release.

### Duty and Training at Units

**6.3** A RESO officer must participate in duty and training at assigned units and is paid for this participation. A RESO officer may request an exemption from duty and training (ED&T) in accordance with CF Mil Pers Instr 20/04, _Administrative Policy of “Class A”, “Class B” and “Class C” Reserve Service_.

7\. Administration
------------------

### Compensation and Benefits

**7.1** A RESO officer is paid in accordance with CBI Chapter 204, _Pay of Officers and Non-commissioned members_.

**7.2** Additional pay increments may be granted for any recognized period of qualifying service, academic or other special qualifications possessed by the RESO officer on enrolment or transfer (see CBI 204.511, _Pay Increments – Reserve Force_).

**7.3** A RESO officer does not receive pay or subsidization for their attendance at post-secondary educational institutions nor are they obliged to serve in the Res F after graduation.

**7.4** A RESO officer may be eligible for the partial reimbursement of education expenses related to academic training under the terms of CBI 210.801, _Education Reimbursement – Primary Reserve_. An ILP must be registered with the CDA prior to the RESO officer requesting any reimbursement under CBI 210.801, and prior to the completion of any course for which the RESO officer intends to submit a claim.

### Non-Effective Strength

**7.5** A RESO officer should be declared as non-effective when their unauthorized absence from duty exceeds the conditions set out in CF Mil Pers Instr 20/04. Procedures for declaring a Res F member non-effective are set out in _The Military Human Resources Records Procedures_ _(MHRRP)_. If attempts to encourage a RESO officer to become effective or to request an ED&T are unsuccessful, the CO must initiate release proceedings.

### Release

**7.6** The reasons, conditions and procedures pertaining to the release of officers, including those declared to be non-effective, are set out in QR&O Chapter 15, _Release_. Procedures for release of CAF members of the P Res are set out in detail in _The Military Human Resources Records Procedures_ _(MHRRP)_.

8\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**8.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for the CAF as an institution and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated.
