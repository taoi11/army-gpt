* * *

2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** The mission of the DND and the CAF is to defend Canada, its interests and its values, while contributing to international peace and security.

**2.2** The duties to be performed by CAF members in the execution of the mission and the CAF are affected by the requirement to:

1.  maintain individual and collective standards of operational effectiveness; and
2.  show due care and consideration for the safety of CAF members and the public.

### Policy Statement

**2.3** In light of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the _Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms_ and the _Canadian Human Rights Act_, the CAF is committed to:

1.  establishing procedures to ensure that restrictions on duty are only imposed if the performance by a CAF member of a specific duty poses or is likely to pose a real and demonstrable risk to the operational effectiveness of the CAF or the safety of CAF members or the public; and
2.  ensuring that individual limitations of CAF members are considered in the assignment of their duties, subject to the principle of universality of service under which CAF members must at all times and under any circumstances perform any functions that they may be required to perform (see subsection 15(9) of the _Canadian Human Rights Act_ concerning universality of service).
