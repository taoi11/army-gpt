3\. Overview
------------

**Context**

**3.1** The CAF is committed to gender integration and employment equity policies as well as a supportive work environment that enables CAF members to balance military duties and family responsibilities.

**3.2** The CAF will help pregnant CAF members to maintain their health, safety and welfare throughout the period of pregnancy and birth. In support of this policy, CAF members are provided adequate time away from military duties with compensation so that they can recuperate from childbirth and care for their new-born child, free from undue financial or duty-related concerns.

4\. Operating Principles
------------------------

**Health Care**

**4.1** A CAF member of the Regular Force or Reserve Force on Class "B" or "C" Reserve Service who is pregnant, or believes she may be pregnant, must report to the supporting CF Health Services (CFHS) facility. Laboratory testing will be ordered to confirm the pregnancy.The CAF member must be examined by a physician and assigned temporary MELs for a specified period of time. Detailed information on the medical administration of pregnant members is found in CF H Svcs Gp Instruction 3100-23**,** _Medical Administration of Pregnant Members_.

**4.2** CAF members may choose to have their pregnancy monitored and their child delivered by a civilian health care provider, e.g., a civilian obstetrician, a family practitioner providing obstetrical care or a midwife where authorized under provincial law.

**Civilian Referrals**

**4.3** If the CAF member chooses a civilian health care provider, she must provide her supporting CF H Svcs Gp facility with the details so that liaison between the civilian health care provider and the CF H Svcs Gp facility may be established.

**4.4** The CF Health Gp facility must:

*   fill all non-emergency prescriptions written by the civilian health care provider;
*   provide diagnostic testing and ultrasounds within its capability; and
*   authorize in advance any tests to be conducted at CAF expense at a civilian health care facility.

**4.5** A CAF member whose pregnancy is being followed by a civilian health care provider must report to the nearest CF H Svcs Gp facility to have recommendations for sick leave or MELs reviewed and approved by a MO.

5\. Duties
----------

**General**

**5.1** Decisions regarding duty during pregnancy must be the result of a consultative process between the CO, MO and the CAF member. If there is any doubt or question as to the potential hazard of any particular duty assignment, including temporary duty or courses, a MO must first certify the fitness of the CAF member to undertake such duty.

**5.2** The CO of a pregnant CAF member must ensure that the CAF member performs duties that:

*   are consistent with the duty limitations indicated by the medical officer; and
*   pose no threat to the health of the member or foetus.

**5.3** Temporary MELs will be assigned in accordance with CF H Svcs Gp Instruction 3100-23.

**Prior to Completion of Basic Training**

**5.4** If a CAF member is diagnosed as pregnant prior to the completion of basic training and requests her release, the CAF member must be released under Item 4(c) of the Table to QR&O article 15.01, _Release of Officers and Non-Commissioned Members_.

**5.5** If a CAF member is diagnosed as pregnant prior to completion of basic military training and does not request her release, she must:

*   continue training if her medical condition permits and any period of absence from training due to pregnancy does not exceed any period of absence that would normally be accepted in the case of short-term illness or injury; or
*   in any other case, cease training and perform other duties pending successful completion of basic military training when medically fit to do so.

**Prior to Occupational Qualification**

**5.6** The following table details actions to be taken if a CAF member is confirmed to be pregnant prior to military occupational qualification.

| If a pregnant member has completed basic training and is undertaking training or subsidized education (hereinafter training), and, in the opinion of a MO, ... | then the CAF member ... |
| --- | --- |
| cannot complete her training,
 | must cease training and perform duties commensurate with her previous training and experience until maternity leave commences.

 |
| is able to complete her current phase of training but is unable to complete the next phase,

 | must perform duties commensurate with previous training or experience commencing at the completion of the phase she is currently attending until such time as maternity leave commences.

 |
| is able to complete all phases of training prior to her expected delivery date,

 | must be permitted to do so.

 |

**5.7** A CAF member required to cease military occupation qualification training due to pregnancy must be rescheduled for a later course.

**Sick Leave**

**6.2** Sick leave is granted under QR&O 16.16, _Sick Leave_, during maternity leave for any period during which, in the opinion of the MO, a CAF member is unfit for duty.

**6.3** The granting of sick leave during maternity leave may affect entitlement to maternity allowance and unemployment insurance maternity benefits.

**6.4** Where a CAF member does not request maternity leave, sick leave is granted for any period during which she is, in the opinion of an MO, unfit for duty.

**6.5** Once an MO determines that the CAF member is again fit for duty, she will commence full or restricted duties in accordance with any MELS that the MO determines to be necessary, having regard to her state of health.

**Dress**

**6.6** A pregnant CAF member must commence wearing the CAF distinctive environmental maternity uniform when other orders of dress are no longer comfortable or appropriate.

**Release**

**6.7** Regular Force pregnant CAF members may request their release in accordance with CFAO 15-2, _Release - Regular Force_.

**6.8** A pregnant CAF member who requests release must be counseled as to her requirement for insurance coverage for medical and hospital care on release.

**6.9** If requested and when medically fit, re-enrolment will be considered without restriction for a CAF member who was released.

If, for reasons beyond the control of the CAF member (medical, operational, etc.), she is unable to vacate the SOA prior to hospitalization, she must be permitted to remain in SOA for up to 17 weeks beyond the date of birth or until the end of maternity leave, whichever is the later. During that time, the CAF member is required to secure MOA or private housing…
