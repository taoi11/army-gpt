1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2007-08-10

* * *

2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** The _Public Service Labour Relations Act_ (PSLRA) recognizes that harmonious and cooperative relations between the employer (management), and bargaining agents and unions (labour), are essential to a productive and effective public service.

**2.2** The term "labour-management relations" in this DAOD refers to the relations between the DND and the bargaining agent or union.

**2.3** This DAOD:

1.  establishes the DND framework for supporting the principles and objectives of the PSLRA; and
2.  permits the creation of labour-management policies and guidelines.

### Policy Statement

**2.4** The DND is committed to fostering respectful and effective labour-management relations, at all levels of the DND, founded on:

1.  open and sustained dialogue;
2.  mutual trust and respect; and
3.  working collaboratively towards common interests.

**2.5** The DND specifically supports this commitment to labour-management relations by recognizing that:

1.  unions represent the interests of their members; and
2.  employee representatives play a strategic role at all levels in maintaining a positive and healthy workplace for DND employees.

### Requirements

**2.6** The DND shall:

1.  develop and implement labour-management policies, guidelines and processes;
2.  participate in labour-management consultations;
3.  provide managers and supervisors with guidance, support and training, if required;
4.  where possible and practicable:
    1.  engage in co-development with bargaining agents; and
    2.  attempt to resolve workplace issues at the earliest stage and lowest organizational level; and
5.  recognize that DND employees who act as employee representatives may require leave with or without pay or time off for union business.

**2.7** Delegated managers shall:

1.  consider the following when making decisions respecting the authorization of leave with or without pay or time off for union business:
    1.  relevant articles in the applicable collective agreement;
    2.  impact on operational requirements and labour-management relations; and
    3.  DND interests; and
2.  respect the relevant articles of the applicable collective agreement and adhere to the _Instrument of Delegation of Labour Relations Authorities_ when granting leave with or without pay or time off for union business.

**2.8** The travel costs of union representatives are primarily the responsibility of bargaining agents and unions, even when meeting with the DND. However, if requested by a union representative, a delegated manager may authorize the subsidization of travel costs in exceptional circumstances if the following conditions are satisfied:

1.  it is substantiated that the presence of the union representative is of vital interest to the DND;
2.  any travel costs authorized are limited and negotiated between the union representative and management; and
3.  the travel costs do not exceed the limits established by the _Travel Directive_.
