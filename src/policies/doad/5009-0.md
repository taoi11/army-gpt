1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2017-04-24

**Date of Last Modification**: 2024-02-23

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces in the Regular Force (Reg F) and the Primary Reserve (P Res) (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Administrative Response Centre (ARC)

2\. Definitions
---------------

**personnel tempo** (_tempo personnel_)

The frequency and duration of the duties and demands imposed on a CAF member by their service.

**Note -** These duties and demands include increased workload, training, career courses, deployments and temporary duty that result in time away from home and family. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 21042)

**readiness** (_préparation_)

The state of being appropriately prepared to meet specific personal, professional and operational demands. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 27069)

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**3.1** CAF strategic objectives, capability requirements, plans and programs require the collection, maintenance and presentation of accurate personnel readiness data. This data enables commanders to effectively screen and track the readiness of their CAF members.

**3.2** A CAF member demonstrates their readiness for selection and assignment to a designated tasking, posting or deployment by having:

1.  acquired the necessary experience and skills;
2.  performed the required training;
3.  demonstrated that they are physically and mentally fit; and
4.  confirmed the status of various administrative processes.

**3.3** Verification of the readiness state of CAF members is known as personnel readiness verification (PRV). PRV screening, as set out in DAOD 5009-1, _Personnel Readiness Verification Screening_, provides accurate, real-time data to support both personnel and operational decisions.

**3.4** The establishment of a PRV screening and tracking system supports:

1.  the strategic intent of the Chief of the Defence Staff and the initiatives of the Strategic Joint Staff in respect of personnel readiness;
2.  force generator requirements to track personnel readiness and provide vital data when required;
3.  force employer requirements to account and care for deployed CAF members; and
4.  commanders and other decision-makers by providing them with accurate human resource data.

**Policy Statement**

**3.5** The CAF is committed to ensuring that:

1.  CAF members undergo required PRV screening; and
2.  there is a balance between personnel tempo and the needs of CAF members by establishing supporting policies, standards, instructions and activities; and
3.  all information collected is treated in accordance with the _Privacy Act_.

**Requirements**

**3.6** The CAF must:

1.  establish protocols, procedures and memoranda of understanding with appropriate organizations to ensure that relevant personnel readiness standards are defined and implemented;
2.  institute and maintain a PRV screening and tracking system;
3.  ensure individual PRV results are kept up-to-date and accurate;
4.  monitor the personnel tempo of CAF members; and
5.  ensure that personnel readiness policies and procedures, including software, adhere to this DAOD.

4\. Consequences
----------------

**General**

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, CAF members may seek direction through their chain of command. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
