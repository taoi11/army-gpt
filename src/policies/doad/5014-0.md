3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** This DAOD and the accompanying _DND Workplace Harassment and Violence Prevention Policy Manual_ (the Manual) serve to enforce DND- and CAF-wide prevention of workplace harassment and violence. The Manual embraces and actively promotes diversity and inclusion as a core value that goes beyond employment equity. The DND and the CAF are committed to ensuring the Manual considers impacts and experiences across genders and multiple intersecting identities when determining the needs of DND employees and CAF members.

**3.2** Occurrences of workplace harassment and violence must be responded to promptly in order to ensure that the workplace remains a respectful and safe environment. Mutual support and respect for the dignity and rights of every person are essential characteristics of the DND and CAF workplace. Not only are certain forms of harassment and violence against the law, but they also erode mutual confidence and respect for individuals and may lead to a poisoned work environment. As a result, operational effectiveness, productivity, team cohesion and morale are placed at risk.

**3.3** A “designated recipient” has been established in CPCC (DGCSS) to receive and resolve notices of occurrence from a DND employee, or a CAF member involved in an occurrence with a DND employee, who wishes to provide notice outside of their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate.

### Policy Statement

**3.4** The DND and the CAF are committed to the empowering and support of all DND employees and CAF members by prevention, resolution and protection against workplace harassment and violence in order to foster a safe and respectful workplace.

### Requirements

**3.5** In order to provide a comprehensive program that prevents, responds and supports the prevention of workplace harassment and violence, the DND and the CAF must:

1.  provide training, jointly developed or identified and endorsed by the National Health and Safety Policy Committee, specific to the culture, conditions and activities of the workplace as it relates to workplace harassment and violence;
2.  create a framework, jointly with the National Health and Safety Policy Committee, for the conduct, review and update of workplace assessments that consists of the identification of hazards, and internal and external risk factors, that contribute to workplace harassment and violence;
3.  develop and implement, jointly with the National Health and Safety Policy Committee, preventive measures to eliminate or minimize the risks related to workplace harassment and violence;
4.  develop, jointly with the National Health and Safety Policy Committee, emergency procedures and support services for DND employees and CAF members related to workplace harassment and violence to ensure the health and safety of DND employees and CAF members;
5.  establish a reporting mechanism for DND employees who experience workplace harassment and violence, and for DND employees or CAF members who witness workplace harassment and violence that involves a DND employee;
6.  promulgate the Manual to support implementation of the requirements of this DAOD;
7.  ensure compliance with the _Work Place Harassment and Violence Prevention Regulations_ (the Regulations);
8.  establish a resolution process that includes initial review, negotiated resolution, reconciliation, prevention, investigation and implementation of recommendations; and
9.  respond to and make every reasonable effort to resolve all workplace harassment and violence occurrences.

**3.6** DND employees and CAF members must be aware that any reprisal against a principal party who has exercised rights or duties under the Regulations or the Manual is unacceptable and incompatible with the standards of civility and respect in the federal public service.

**3.7** Section 147 of the _Canada Labour Code_ prohibits employers from taking, or threatening to take, any punitive or disciplinary action against employees who have acted in accordance with the Code and the Regulations. If a DND employee believes that DND or the CAF has violated this provision, the DND employee may notify the designated recipient or appropriate human resources personnel. If this is not successful, under section 133 of the Code, the DND employee may file a complaint with the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board.

### Reporting of a Notice of Occurrence

**3.8** Managers and commanding officers must report the reception of a notice of occurrence to WHVP CoE within seven calendar days.

### Individuals other than DND Employees or CAF Members in the Workplace

**3.9** Occurrences of workplace harassment and violence that involve individuals other than DND employees or CAF members are also governed by the _Canada Labour Code, Part II_ and the Regulations. The DND and the CAF are required to ensure that:

1.  contractors, visitors, federal public service employees from other departments or agencies and other individuals granted access to the workplace are made aware of this DAOD and the Regulations;
2.  DND employees and CAF members who grant individuals access to the workplace are made aware of their responsibility to ensure that individuals granted access respect the policy in this DAOD on the prevention, resolution and protection against workplace harassment and violence; and
3.  appropriate action is taken to prevent or respond to occurrences of any workplace harassment and violence which may involve such individuals.

**3.10** The designated recipient is responsible for determining, on a case-by-case basis, if an occurrence of workplace harassment and violence involving an individual other than a DND employee or CAF member is subject to the Regulations.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
