**3.3** Subsection 12(1) of the _Financial Administration Act_ (FAA) authorizes every deputy head in the core public administration, with respect to the portion for which he or she is deputy head, to establish standards of discipline and prescribe financial and other penalties to be applied for breaches of discipline or misconduct.

**3.4** For direction on exercising disciplinary measures, see the _Guidelines for Civilian Discipline_ (Treasury Board)_._

### Policy Statement

**3.5** DND employees are responsible at all times for conforming to established standards of conduct.

    1.  legislation and regulations;
    2.  departmental policies and directives;
    3.  Treasury Board policies; and
    4.  the _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_;
2.  act in a manner that is:
    1.  consistent with departmental interests;

4\. Consequences

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate.
