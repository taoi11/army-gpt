2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** Mental health is the state of psychological and social well-being from which the capacity to function effectively in both occupational and personal relationships is derived.

**2.2** The CAF physical and social environments (including military units, living conditions, work milieu, social and recreational facilities, support services etc.) play a part in influencing the mental health of its members. At times, the organizational and personal demands imposed by the CAF environment may tax or overwhelm an individual's ability to cope or may aggravate a pre-existing condition. This can affect the member's quality of life and that of their family as well as the member's ability to carry out their military duties.

**2.3** Maintenance of good mental health is critical to the quality of life of CAF members and their families and to the operational readiness of the CAF.

### Policy Statement

**2.4** The CAF is committed to:

1.  promoting and safeguarding the mental health of its members; and
2.  providing appropriate interventions and treatment for CAF members who experience mental health problems, and related support to CAF families where appropriate.

### Requirements

**2.5** All CAF members must take an active part in maintaining their personal health, creating and supporting a climate that fosters positive mental health and striving to reduce or eliminate the factors that put mental health at risk.
