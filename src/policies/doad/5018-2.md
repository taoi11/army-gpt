3\. Overview
------------

**Context**

**3.1** CAF members may be required to serve in situations that can be dangerous to their life or health. Eligibility requirements for certain pensions and other benefits, e.g. under the _Veterans Well-being Act and the Compensation and Benefits Instructions for the Canadian Forces_ (CBI), necessitate the reporting and documenting of any injury, disease or illness that has occurred, or any exposure or suspected exposure to a toxic substance.

4\. Process
-----------

**Completion of Form CF 98**

**4.1** A commanding officer (CO) must ensure that form CF 98, _Report of Injury, Disease or Illness, is completed if:_

a. a CAF member suffers an injury, disease or illness; or  
b. there is an exposure or suspected exposure of a CAF member to a toxic substance.

**Note _–_** A CO is also required to report any exposure or suspected exposure to nuclear and ionizing radiation in accordance with the _Nuclear Safety Orders and Directives and DAOD 4002-0, Nuclear and Ionizing Radiation Safety Management_.

**4.2** Form CF 98 serves as a permanent record of the relevant circumstances pertaining to an injury, disease, illness or exposure or suspected exposure to a toxic substance and is retained on the CAF personnel record of the injured or ill CAF member.

**4.3** Form CF 98 includes detailed instructions for the completion of the four sections of the form and its distribution. A CO must ensure that a reporting officer is appointed without delay for the completion of section 3 of form CF 98. The reporting officer’s statement in section 3 provides a brief explanation which will assist Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) in determining if the injury, disease, illness or exposure or suspected exposure to a toxic substance arose out of or was directly connected to military service. Form CF 98 is just one source document that may be used by VAC to determine possible pension-related entitlements.

**4.4** When a CAF member on temporary duty or attached posting suffers an injury, disease or illness, or there is an exposure or suspected exposure of the CAF member to a toxic substance, the CO of the host unit must ensure that form CF 98 is completed and distributed, and that an information copy is sent to the parent unit of the CAF member for retention on the CAF personnel record.

**Note _–_** See CBI 1.28 for the definitions of “temporary duty” and “attached duty.”

**Amendment**

**4.5** Any person making an amendment to information recorded on form CF 98 must sign and date the amendment.

**Time Limit**

**4.6** Form CF 98 must be completed and forwarded to DCSM as soon as practicable when the CAF member suffers an injury, disease or illness or there is an exposure or suspected exposure to a toxic substance. Form CF 98 must not be delayed even if the injured or ill CAF member is unable to make a statement in section 2 of the form. If a CAF member is initially unable to make a statement, a new form CF 98 must be completed when the CAF member is able to make their statement and subsequently forwarded to DCSM as soon as administratively possible.

5\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

**Compliance**

**5.1** CAF members must comply with this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**5.2** CAF members are accountable to their military leaders for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may result in administrative or disciplinary action, or both.

**5.3** Failure to comply with the processes set out in this DAOD may negatively impact a CAF member’s eligibility for certain pensions and other benefits, e.g. under the _Veterans Well-being Act and the CBI_.
