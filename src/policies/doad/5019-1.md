3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The CAF is committed to:

1.  respecting the inherent right of CAF members to form personal relationships of their choosing;
2.  respecting the privacy of the personal relationships of CAF members; and
3.  providing fair and unbiased treatment to persons in the care or under the protection of CAF members and preventing the exploitation of vulnerable persons.

### Role of the Chain of Command

| To achieve the objective of the ... | the chain of command must ... |
| --- | --- |
| prevention of erosion of lawful authority,

4\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Personal Conduct

**4.1** CAF members in a personal relationship must refrain from conduct that may be considered unprofessional in a military context. For example, a CAF member while in uniform in public with another person must not:

1.  hold hands;
2.  kiss, except in greeting and farewell; or
3.  caress or embrace in a romantic manner.

**4.2** A CAF member in a personal relationship with another CAF member, DND employee or member of an allied force, contractor or an employee of a contractor must not be involved, regardless of rank or authority, in the other person’s:

1.  performance appraisal or reporting, including training evaluations and audits;
2.  posting, transfer or attached posting;
3.  individual training or education;
4.  duties or scheduling for duties;
5.  documents or records;
6.  grievance process; or
7.  release proceedings.

**4.3** CAF members must notify their chain of command of any personal relationship that could compromise the objectives of this DAOD.

### Administrative Intervention

**4.4** In order to protect CAF members in vulnerable situations and to ensure fair treatment, restrictions may be imposed on the duty or posting of CAF members involved in a personal relationship if the circumstances could result in:

1.  an instructor/student relationship that would have an effect on the security, morale, cohesion and discipline of a unit; or
2.  a senior/subordinate or inter-rank personal relationship in the same direct chain of command if there is a difference in rank or authority.

**4.5** Commanding officers (COs) must apply appropriate situational-specific criteria when dealing with individual situations or establishing any local policy with respect to personal relationships. Before establishing any local policy, unit authorities should consult with the local representative of the Judge Advocate General (JAG). Any local policy must not be less restrictive than this DAOD.

### Fraternization

**4.6** Fraternization can have detrimental effects on unit operation effectiveness due to potential threats to the security, morale, cohesion and discipline of a unit. Task force commanders must issue orders and guidance on fraternization appropriate to the situation in their area of operations.

5\. Administrative Action
-------------------------

### Adverse Personal Relationships

**5.1** If a personal relationship has a negative effect on the security, cohesion, discipline or morale of a unit, the personal relationship is considered adverse for the purpose of this DAOD.

**5.2** Administrative action must be taken to separate CAF members who are involved in an adverse personal relationship.

**5.3** If an adverse personal relationship cannot be changed within the applicable unit/sub-unit for the CAF members in a supervisor/subordinate relationship, the CAF members must be separated by attached posting, posting, change in work assignments or other action.

**5.4** Such a separation is not punitive in nature, nor must there be a negative stigma or career implication towards the CAF members.

### Postings

**5.5** CAF members who are known to be, or have declared themselves to be involved, in a personal relationship must normally not be posted to the same unit. If the unit is of sufficient size that posting the CAF members involved is unlikely to have an adverse effect on the security, cohesion, discipline or morale of the unit, they may be posted to same unit, but not the same sub-unit.

**5.6** CAF members who form a personal relationship must normally complete current postings, provided the work relationship does not have a negative effect on the security, cohesion, discipline or morale of the unit.

### Criteria for Decision to Post

**5.7** If CAF members are involved in an adverse personal relationship and posting is being considered, the CO must consult Director General Military Careers (DGMC) or the appropriate reserve authority.

**5.8** The decision having the least negative career effect on both CAF members must be taken, considering:

1.  future career prospects for both CAF members; and
2.  the effects upon both CAF members of an internal reassignment, attached posting, posting or sub-component transfer.

### Posting Process

**5.9** The following table outlines the process for a posting if the personal relationship of a CAF member may be adverse:

| Who does it? | Action |
| --- | --- |
| The CO of the CAF member
 | determines if the personal relationship is adverse and …

 |
| 

 | **if a CAF member of the …**

 | **then the CO must forward all particulars along with a recommendation …** |
| Regular Force,

 | for posting to DGMC. |
| Reserve Force,

 | for an attached posting, internal reassignment, posting or sub-component transfer to:

*   the applicable area commander or equivalent for the Primary Reserve;
    
*   the applicable regional commander for the Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service;
    
*   the area commander for the Canadian Rangers; or
    
*   the area commander or equivalent of the sub-component to which the member is attached for the Supplementary Reserve.
    

 |
| Director Reserve Support Management

(CO Supplementary Reserve) | reviews and, if in the interests of the CAF, approves a sub-component compulsory transfer under QR&O 10.06, _Transfer Between Sub-Components of the Reserve Force_ to the Supplementary Reserve.

**Note -** A sub-component compulsory transfer to the Supplementary Reserve is considered to be an option of last resort. It is not to be considered punitive in nature.

 |

### Disciplinary and Career Action

**5.10** Before taking disciplinary and/or career action for conduct which is contrary to this DAOD, unit authorities should consult with the local representative of the JAG.

6\. Responsibilities
