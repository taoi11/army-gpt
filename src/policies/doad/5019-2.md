4\. General Principles
----------------------

### Context

**4.1**¬†Each CAF member is required to maintain professional standards of conduct and performance. When an incident, a special circumstance, or a conduct or performance deficiency occurs that violates professional standards and calls into question the viability of a CAF member's continued service, an administrative action may be appropriate.

**4.2**¬†An AR is the process to determine the most appropriate administrative action, if any, in such a case (see paragraph 5.9 of this DAOD for possible administrative actions which may be initiated as a result of an AR).

**Note** - Administrative action in the form of a remedial measure may be initiated in accordance with DAOD 5019-4, _Remedial Measures_, without the conduct of an AR under DAOD 5019-2.

**4.3** As part of the AR process, the CAF must ensure that administrative actions:

1.  respect DAOD 5516-5, _Learning Disability Accommodation during Recruiting, Training and Education_, and DAOD 5023-0, _Universality of Service_; and
2.  are not based, in whole or in part, on any prohibited ground of discrimination, as set out in the CHRA, i.e. race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability or conviction of an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.

**4.4**¬†The CAF is committed to an AR process that is fair.

### Staff Involvement and AAs in the AR Process

**4.5**¬†The AR process in respect of a CAF member involves at least two Reg F or Res F officers as follows:

1.  one or more staff officers who act as AR analysts and are responsible for conducting the AR analysis; and
2.  one who acts as the AA and is authorized to select and initiate, if appropriate as a result of the AR process, an administrative action in accordance with QR&O or a DAOD.

### AR Types

**4.6**¬†The following table identifies, by type of AR and component, the AR analyst and the officer who is authorized to act as the AA:

| AR Type | Component | AR Analyst | AA (Note 1) | For CAF members of the rank or designation of rank of ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

 |
| MEL that does not breach the principle of U of S (Note 6) | Reg F or Res F | unit staff | CO | Pte/OS/Avr to LCol/Cdr |
| **Note 1 ‚Äì** The AA's authority may not be delegated.

**Note 2 ‚Äì** A conduct deficiency occurs if the CAF member does not meet an established standard of behaviour in a regulation, code of conduct, policy, order, instruction or directive applicable to the CAF member. Examples of conduct deficiencies are prohibited drug use, other involvement with drugs, alcohol misconduct, sexual misconduct, harassment, racist conduct, hateful conduct and family violence.

**Note 3 ‚Äì** Abbreviations of ranks and designations of rank in this DAOD are used in accordance with the Defence Terminology Bank. See column 3 of the table to QR&O article 3.01, _Ranks and Designation of Ranks_, for additional designations of rank for CAF members who hold the rank of private and wear an army uniform.

**Note 4 ‚Äì** A performance deficiency occurs if a CAF member does not meet an established standard of performance expected of the CAF member in the execution of their duties, tasks or responsibilities, including a minimum operational standard related to U of S under DAOD 5023-1, _Minimum Operational Standards Related to Universality of Service._

**Note 5 ‚Äì** An AR is conducted if D Med Pol assigns a MEL and DMCA makes the determination that the MEL breaches the principle of U of S.

**Note 6 ‚Äì**¬† If a MEL is assigned that does not result in a breach of the principle of U of S but the AR may result in a release recommendation, a compulsory occupational transfer or a recommendation for continued service subject to employment limitations, the case must be referred by the AA to DMCA.

 |

### Procedural Fairness

**4.7**¬†The following table identifies the minimum steps that must be taken to ensure the AR process is fair:

| Step | What Happens? |
| --- | --- |
| Notification
 | The AA must inform the CAF member that an AR is to be conducted to evaluate the CAF member's service and to select the most appropriate administrative action, if any, in the circumstances.

 |
| Disclosure

 | The AA must provide the CAF member with a disclosure package containing either:

*   a copy of all relevant documents and other information; or
*   a summary of all relevant information.

**Note ‚Äì** The disclosure package is used by the AA to reach a decision. |
| Representations

 | When the disclosure package is received, the CAF member may provide written representations to the AA, including arguments and facts that may not have been included with the disclosure package and any correction to the disclosed documents and other information that the CAF member considers necessary.

 |
| Consideration of all information

 | The AA considers the disclosure package and any representations made by the CAF member and then reaches a decision.

 |
| Provision of decision

 | The AA provides the decision to the CAF member through the CAF member's CO.

 |
| **Note ‚Äì** An AR analyst may act on behalf of an AA during any of the above steps, except the _Consideration of all information_ step. |

5\. Administrative Review Process
---------------------------------

### Action Prior to AR Process

**5.1** The AR process may be initiated for a conduct or performance deficiency with or without:

1.  the prior administration of a remedial measure under DAOD 5019-4; or
2.  a recommendation from the CoC that an AR be conducted.

**Note ‚Äì** A CO is required to contact DMCA in any case of hateful conduct or sexual misconduct.

### Authorities Who May Recommend an AR

**5.2** An AR in respect of a CAF member may be recommended by:

1.  an initiating authority, as identified in DAOD 5019-4, when:
    1.  remedial measures fail to rectify a conduct or performance deficiency; or
    2.  an incident, a special circumstance, or a conduct or performance deficiency occurs that violates professional standards and calls into question the viability of the CAF member‚Äôs continued service;
2.  a career manager or the Res F equivalent, or the CO of a recruiting or training establishment following a training failure;
3.  DMCA staff or the L2 HQ or equivalent staff if D Med Pol has assigned a permanent MEL; or
4.  a CO when a CAF member cannot meet any one of the minimum operational standards under the principle of U of S (see DAOD 5023-1).

### AR Process Table

**5.3** The following table is an example of the AR process in which an AR analyst acts on behalf of an AA:

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1
 | The authority who recommends an AR must forward the recommendation and all supporting evidence to the appropriate AR analyst.

 |
| 2

 | The AR analyst creates an AR case file.

 |
| 3

 | The AR analyst sends an advisory message to the CAF member through the CAF member's CO.

 |
| 4

 | The AR analyst obtains the significant incident report, military police investigation report, board of inquiry report or other relevant information, as applicable.

 |
| 5

 | If there may be a breach of U of S, the AR analyst obtains, in accordance with DAOD 5023-1, military occupation information, for example, Annual Military Occupation Review information, rank documentation, etc., from the applicable authority.

 |
| 6

 | The AR analyst:

*   reviews all documentation;
*   prepares a case file synopsis (if required); and
*   prepares a recommendation to be reviewed and approved by the CoC.

 |
| 7

 | The CoC reviews the documentation, case file synopsis (if included) and recommendation prepared by the AR analyst and submits a recommendation.

 |
| 8

 | A disclosure package is forwarded to the CAF member through the CAF member's CO with a copy of the case synopsis, any recommendation from the CoC and all other documents and information to be considered by the AA.

**Note ‚Äì** The CAF member may expedite the AR process by informing the AR analyst in writing that they do not wish to receive the disclosure package. |
| 9

 | The CAF member may make written representations to the AA through the AR analyst, not later than 30 calendar days after the day that the CAF member receives the disclosure package. If the CAF member does not have sufficient time to make representations, the CAF member may, in writing, request additional time from the AR analyst. The 30 calendar-day time limit is to be interpreted flexibly and reasonably and to take into consideration the CAF member's circumstances. The CO then has 10 calendar days to review the CAF member's representations and provide comments to the AA, with an information copy to the CAF member.

 |
| 10

 | If comments are made, for example by the CO or AR analyst, with respect to the CAF member's representations, the CAF member must be provided with the comments and may make further representations based on the comments.

 |
| 11

 | The AA:

*   reviews the AR case file, including the disclosure package and the CAF member's representations if provided;
*   reaches a decision; and
*   provides a written decision to the AR analyst, including the reasons for the decision.

 |
| 12

 | The AR analyst forwards the AA's written decision, including the reasons for the decision, to the CAF member through the CAF member's CO.

 |

### Standard of Proof and Evidence

**5.4** Administrative action may be initiated only if there is clear and convincing evidence establishing on the balance of probabilities that an incident, a special circumstance, or a conduct or performance deficiency has occurred that violates professional standards and calls into question the viability of a CAF member's continued service.

### Selection of Administrative Action

**5.5** The selection of administrative action by an AA must be based upon consideration of the following:

1.  the facts of the present case;
2.  the CAF member's entire period of service, taking into account the CAF member's rank, military occupation, experience and position;
3.  any previous conduct or performance deficiency, with consideration of the degree to which the CAF member:
    1.  accepted responsibility or demonstrated remorse for the deficiency; and
    2.  took active steps to modify their conduct or performance;
4.  the CAF member's leadership role, if any;
5.  the result of required consultation with local CF Health Services;
6.  the existence of any MEL and disclosed disability, as well as any other employment limitation, subject to the requirements of the principle of U of S in accordance with DAODs 5023-0 and 5023-1; and
7.  the CAF member‚Äôs representations, if any.

**5.6** Although there may exist a link between a demonstrated behavioural issue and a disability, a disability does not automatically excuse a CAF member from the requirement to meet established standards of conduct and performance set out in regulations, codes of conduct, policies, orders, instructions and directives applicable to the CAF member. However, the AA must take the disability and the CAF member‚Äôs overall conduct and performance into account and ensure that any administrative action does not conflict with the CHRA.

### AR Decisions

**5.7** Before any administrative action is initiated, the AA must ensure that they are authorized by QR&O or a DAOD to initiate the selected action.

**5.8**¬†As a general principle, the appropriate administrative action is the one that best reflects the degree of incompatibility between the CAF member's conduct or performance deficiency and the CAF member's continued service in the CAF.

**5.9**¬†Once an AR case file has been reviewed and a decision reached, the AA may, under applicable regulations, policies, orders, instructions and directives, initiate an administrative action, including:

*   remedial measures under DAOD 5019-4;
*   occupational transfer;
*   transfer between sub-components;
*   posting;
*   an offer of terms of service in any case in which an offer has not been made by CAF authorities;
*   reversion in rank; or
*   release or recommendation for release, as applicable.

**5.10** If the decision is release, the CAF member is to be released under the most appropriate item in the Table to QR&O article 15.01 _Release of Officers And Non-Commissioned Members_. CDS guidelines on the selection of the appropriate release in certain specific cases are set out in the _Consideration for Attribution of a Release Item_ document.

### Reasons

**5.11**¬†The reasons for initiating an administrative action in respect of a CAF member must contain sufficient information:

1.  to enable the CAF member to understand why the administrative action was initiated; and
2.  to permit review by grievance authorities.

**5.12**¬†The reasons provided must specifically:

1.  identify the applicable evidence;
2.  explain how the evidence was treated; and
3.  state any findings based upon the evidence, and given those findings, explain why the specific administrative action was initiated.

### AR Case Files

**5.13**¬†AR case files must be retained in accordance with policies and procedures set out in the following documents, as applicable:

*   [DAOD 5050-0](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/5000-series/5050/5050-0-canadian-forces-personnel-records.html), _Canadian Forces Personnel Records_;
*   [A-PM-245-001/FP-001, _Military Human Resources Records Procedures_](https://aideghelp.hrms.mil.ca/eng/data/toc.html); and
*   _Defence Subject Classification and Disposition System_.

6\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

#### Compliance

**6.1** CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, CAF members may seek direction through their CoC. Military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of CAF members with this DAOD.

#### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**6.2** CAF members are accountable to their military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the CAF as an institution, and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the _Code of Service Discipline_ regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**6.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and CAF policies and instructions;
