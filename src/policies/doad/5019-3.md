 |

### Range of Actions

**5.3** The range of actions employed by the CAF to deter and detect prohibited drug use and other involvement with drugs, as described in detail in the _Education_ map and other blocks, includes:

1.  education;
2.  CFDCP implementation;
3.  individual reporting;
4.  enforcement;
5.  investigation;
6.  notification of DMCA;
7.  review of duties;
8.  drug testing; and
9.  other appropriate administrative or disciplinary action, or both.

### CFDCP Implementation

**5.4** The chain of command is responsible for establishing programs to ensure a drug-free and impairment-free workforce. This includes education under the CFDCP, as well as taking appropriate action if prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs is suspected.

### Individual Reporting

**5.5** CAF members have a responsibility to report infringements of the CFDCP to the appropriate CAF authorities.

### Enforcement

**5.6** All levels of the chain of command are responsible for taking appropriate measures under the CFDCP if suspected prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs is brought to their attention.

### Investigation

**5.7** A commanding officer (CO) must ensure that any suspected prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs is investigated as soon as practicable.

**5.8** The CO may contact the Military Police or the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service for assistance and guidance in determining the most appropriate form of investigation.

**5.9** Upon initiation of an investigation of suspected prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs, the CO must consult with DMCA in regard to both testing and administrative recourse.

### Notification of DMCA

**5.10** If prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs is suspected on reasonable grounds to have taken place_,_ the CO must immediately advise DMCA using the appropriate form in A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000.

### Review of Duties

**5.11** If a CO has reasonable grounds to believe that a CAF member has been engaged in prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs, the CO must conduct a review of the CAF member's present duties with respect to:

1.  considering the temporary re-assignment of the CAF member to different duties within the unit;
2.  the implications for security, as outlined in the _National Defence Security Policy,_ Chapter 36, _Security Clearances_, and
3.  the implications for human reliability.

**5.12** If required, a _Change of Circumstances Report_ must be forwarded in accordance with _National Defence Security Policy_, Chapter 36.

### Drug Testing

**5.13** To monitor and detect drug use, QR&O Chapter 20 authorizes mandatory drug testing for specific purposes in defined circumstances.

**5.14** DMCA must be consulted for any clarification of drug testing under QR&O Chapter 20.

**5.15** A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 sets out detailed testing procedures and standards for drug testing. Testing procedures and standards are modelled on the _Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs_, published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America.

### CO Authority to Order Testing

1.  QR&O article 20.10, _Accident and Incident Related Testing_;
2.  QR&O article 20.11, _Testing for Cause_; and
3.  QR&O article 20.12, _Control Testing_.

**5.17** See A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 for the applicable drug testing order forms.

### Failure or Refusal to Submit to a Drug Test

**5.18** QR&O paragraph 20.14(2), _Failure or Refusal to Provide a Urine Sample,_ provides that failure or refusal to provide a sample of urine, when required to do so for drug testing purposes in accordance with QR&O Chapter 20, may result in disciplinary or administrative action, or both.

### Adulterated, Diluted or Substituted Sample

**5.19** A CAF member who provides for testing an adulterated sample, a diluted sample or a substituted sample, or any other sample of urine made unsuitable for testing by the CAF member, must be:

1.  considered as having failed to provide a sample of urine when required to so in accordance with QR&O Chapter 20; and
2.  subject to administrative review (AR) in accordance with DAOD 5019-2, _Administrative Review._

### Accident and Incident Testing

**5.20** QR&O article 20.10 sets out the conditions under which a CO may order a CAF member to undergo drug testing as a result of an accident or incident.

**5.21** The information used by the CO to form a reasonable belief that an act or omission of one or more of the CAF members to be tested could have caused or contributed to the occurrence of an accident or incident may come from a variety of sources.

**5.22** See A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 for guidance on accident and incident testing.

### Testing for Cause

**5.23** QR&O article 20.11 sets out the conditions under which a CO may order a CAF member to undergo drug testing when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the CAF member has used a prohibited drug.

**5.24** The information used by the CO as the basis to decide if reasonable grounds exist to order a test for cause may come from a variety of sources.

**5.26** QR&O article 20.12 sets out the conditions under which a CO may order a CAF member to undergo drug testing for control and the frequency of such testing.

**5.27** See the _Administrative Control Testing_ block and A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 for guidance on control testing.

### Designation of an Officer to Order Certain Testing

**5.28** Only an officer designated by the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) is authorized to order any of the following drug testing:

1.  QR&O article 20.08, _Deterrent Testing_;
2.  QR&O article 20.09, _Testing of Members in High Risk Safety Sensitive Positions_; and
3.  QR&O article 20.13_, Blind Testing_.

**5.29** See A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 for the format of a designation order.

### Deterrent Testing

**5.30** QR&O article 20.08 sets out the conditions under which deterrent testing may be ordered to detect CAF members using drugs contrary to QR&O article 20.04.

**5.31** See A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 for guidance on deterrent testing.

### High Risk Safety Sensitive Testing

**5.32** QR&O article 20.09 sets out the conditions for the testing of CAF members in any occupation or position designated by the CDS where, in the CDS's opinion, a high risk to the safety of individuals would be created if a CAF member in the occupation or position were under the influence of a drug while on duty.

**5.33** Designating an occupation or position requires a balancing of the CAF's interest in safety with the CAF member's privacy interest and right to security of person. If the risk to safety in an occupation or position is high should there be prohibited drug use, the more likely that the occupation or position will be designated as safety sensitive.

**5.34** When determining if an occupation or position should be designated, the CDS assesses all relevant considerations leading to a high risk to the safety of individuals (see paragraph 9 of the CDS letter dated 30 July 2007, _Expansion: Safety Sensitive Drug Testing_, for a list of considerations).

**5.35** The CDS expects that all CAF members in designated safety sensitive occupation or position must be tested at least once every year.

**5.36** See the DMCA web site for the current list of designated occupations and positions and the list of officers who may order safety sensitive drug testing.

**5.37** See A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 for guidance on the ordering of drug testing of CAF members in designated occupations or positions.

### Blind Testing

**5.38** QR&O article 20.13 sets out the conditions for the ordering of a CAF member to provide a sample of urine on an anonymous basis. Such testing may be used to determine:

1.  the prevalence of prohibited drug use in the CAF; and
2.  the requirement for possible changes in programs or policies.

**5.39** See A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000 for guidance on blind testing.

### Drug Testing Outside Canada

**5.40** A CAF member who is on exchange or secondment with a foreign military service, on course outside Canada or posted to a position outside Canada, remains subject to the CFDCP.

**5.41** A CAF member who is on exchange or secondment with a foreign military service, or on course outside Canada, must comply with the drug control and testing rules of the foreign military service of the country where the CAF member is serving or on course.

**5.42** A CAF member who is to be employed outside Canada on exchange or secondment, or sent on course or posted outside Canada, must be made aware by the dispatching authority of the drug testing policies of the foreign military service and the host country.

**5.43** CAF authorities do not exercise authority in respect of the application of the drug testing policy of a foreign military service or host country.

### Available Actions

**5.44** In response to prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs by a CAF member, the chain of command may take, as appropriate in the circumstances, administrative or disciplinary action, or both.

**5.45** Administrative action may be taken in respect of prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs that takes place at any time by a CAF member.

**5.46** The CMP, the Director General Military Careers (DGMC) and DMCA are the only authorities who may impose administrative action in respect of prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs.

### Administrative Action

**5.47** An AR in respect of prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs is conducted in accordance with DAOD 5019-2.

**5.48** Before selecting any administrative action in respect of prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs by a CAF member, CMP, DGMC or DMCA, as applicable, must consider the following:

1.  the facts of the CAF member's case, including:
    1.  the nature of the drug in issue;
    2.  the means of detection;
    3.  the type of prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs;
    4.  the location and time of the prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs; and
    5.  the degree of impact on CAF operations, activities, safety, security and morale;
2.  the CAF member's entire period of service, taking into account the CAF member's rank, military occupation, experience and position;
3.  the CAF member's previous prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs, if any;
4.  the CAF member's leadership role, if any; and
5.  the CAF member's history of referral for medical assessment for prohibited drug use.

**5.49** As a general principle, the appropriate administrative action is the one that best reflects the degree of incompatibility between the CAF member's prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs and the CAF member's continued service in the CAF.

**5.50** Administrative action which may be taken is set out in the _AR Decisions_ block in DAOD 5019-2.

### Disciplinary Action

**5.51** Disciplinary action may be taken under the Code of Service Discipline for prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs.

**5.52** A CAF member may also be subject to prosecution in civil court.

### Administrative Control Testing

**5.53** As a part of administrative action, control testing may be ordered under QR&O article 20.12 to confirm the continued abstinence from prohibited drug use by a CAF member when:

1.  it is confirmed that the CAF member has engaged in prohibited drug use; and
2.  the CAF member is to be retained in the CAF.

**5.54** Only a CO may order control testing. A CO must order control testing with the minimum frequency that is reasonably necessary to confirm continued abstinence from prohibited drug use by the CAF member, and must order that at least half of all control tests be conducted during any period of associated administrative action.

**5.55** The CO should consider the following when determining the frequency of control testing:

1.  the type of drug the CAF member is confirmed to have used; and
2.  the time period during which any future use could reasonably be detected by urine testing (see the chart specifying detection periods for different drugs in A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000).

**5.56** Control testing may only be administered during the one-year period after the day that the first control test sample of urine is provided.

6\. Treatment and Rehabilitation
--------------------------------

### General

**6.1** The chain of command is responsible for ensuring that a CAF member who is believed to be displaying unacceptable drug-related conduct or performance is offered assistance from a CAF medical care provider.

**6.2** Assessment and treatment of drug-related health problems, including drug dependency, is a medical responsibility of CAF health services. Treatment is arranged by the CAF member's unit medical facility and may include in-patient or out-patient treatment as well as follow-up for relapse prevention.

**6.3** Treatment and rehabilitation available for members of the Reserve Force are set out in ADM(HR-Mil) Instruction 03/04, _The_ _Canadian Forces Spectrum of Care_. Treatment and rehabilitation procedures do not apply, generally, to:

1.  CAF members of the Primary Reserve on Class "A" Reserve Service; or
2.  CAF members of the Canadian Rangers, Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service and Supplementary Reserve unless serving on Reserve Service in excess of 180 days.

### Disclosure of Personal Medical Information

**6.4** Specific diagnosis and treatment of a CAF member, and any other information obtained during a medical or social work examination or interview, must not be disclosed to or discussed with the CO or any non-medical personnel unless the disclosure is required by law or the CAF member has provided an informed written consent.

**6.5** A CAF medical care provider must fully describe and explain, by appropriate means, to the CO of a CAF member:

1.  any medical employment limitations (MELs) assigned to the CAF member, including any limitations on the use of weapons or complex machinery or equipment; and
2.  any time required away from the workplace for medical reasons.

**6.6** A CAF medical care provider may be required by law in certain circumstances to disclose information about a CAF member to a third party without the consent of the CAF member.

### CAF Member Responsibility

**6.7** CAF members must inform their supervisor of any MELs and any time required away from the workplace for medical reasons. The CAF member must comply with all limitations.

### Mandatory Medical Assessment for Drug Use Dependency

**6.8** If it is determined that prohibited drug use has occurred, the CO must immediately refer the CAF member to a CAF medical care provider for an assessment for drug dependency.

**6.9** The purpose of this assessment is to determine whether treatment is recommended. A referral is ordered using the _Medical Referral and Certification_ form in A-AD-005-DCP/AG-000.

**6.10** The chain of command may take appropriate administrative or disciplinary action, or both, to address a CAF member's prohibited drug use or other involvement with drugs, regardless of the CAF member's decision on treatment.

**6.11** Only a CAF medical care provider may assess, offer treatment for and treat drug dependency.

### Voluntary Treatment

**6.12** A CAF member who is concerned about drug use is encouraged to voluntarily seek assistance.

### Treatment Refusal

**6.13** Treatment for drug dependency is voluntary, i.e. a CAF member is not obliged to accept treatment. However, a CAF medical care provider must document any refusal of treatment on the CAF member's medical file and shall advise the CAF member's CO of any continuing MELs.

**6.14** Refusing treatment for drug dependency does not preclude:

1.  the CAF member's CO making another mandatory referral for medical assessment at a later date; or
2.  the CAF member volunteering for assessment or treatment at a later date.

### Treatment After Release

**6.15** Medical treatment by health authorities, other than CAF health services, may be provided after release.
