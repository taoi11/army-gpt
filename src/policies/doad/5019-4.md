4\. General Principles
----------------------

### General

**4.1** Each CAF member is required to maintain professional standards of conduct and performance. If a CAF member has demonstrated a conduct or performance deficiency, an appropriate remedial measure may be initiated.

**4.2** The CAF must ensure that all remedial measures:

1.  respect DAOD 5516-5, _Learning Disability Accommodation during Recruiting, Training and Education_, and DAOD 5023-0, _Universality of Service_; and
2.  are not based, in whole or in part, on any prohibited ground of discrimination, as set out in the CHRA, i.e. race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability or conviction of an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.

**4.3** Remedial measures are serious steps to assist a CAF member in overcoming their conduct or performance deficiency and are based on established CAF standards.

### Standard of Conduct

**4.4** The standard of conduct for a CAF member is based on established military standards, ethics and values identified in regulations, codes of conduct, policies, orders, instructions and directives applicable to the CAF member, including the standards of conduct expressed in _Duty with Honour: The Profession of Arms in Canada_.

### Standard of Performance

**4.5** The standard of performance for a CAF member is based on established military standards applicable to the CAF member’s current rank, military occupation, experience and position. The standard of performance establishes the level of performance expected of a CAF member in the execution of duties, tasks and responsibilities.

**4.6** This DAOD does not replace existing performance appraisal procedures for untrained CAF members undergoing IT&E who fail to meet IT&E objectives.

### Remedial Measures

**4.7** Remedial measures are part of the range of administrative actions which may be initiated in respect of a CAF member and are intended to:

1.  make the CAF member aware of any conduct or performance deficiency;
2.  assist the CAF member in overcoming the deficiency; and
3.  provide the CAF member with time to correct their conduct or improve their performance.

**4.8** Remedial measures initiated in respect of a CAF member are, in increasing significance:

1.  IC;
2.  RW; and
3.  C&P.

### Initiating Authority

**4.9** The IA:

1.  selects the most appropriate remedial measure;
2.  initiates and administers the remedial measure; and
3.  delivers or causes to be delivered to the CAF member the appropriate forms under this DAOD.

**4.10** The following can be IAs for remedial measures in relation to conduct and performance deficiencies:

*   the CO of the CAF member or an officer designated in writing by the CO;
*   the officer commanding the command or formation of the CAF member;
*   DMCA;
*   D Mil C;
*   DSA;
*   any officer of the rank of colonel or above at NDHQ;
*   DGMC or any other CAF director general at NDHQ;
*   CMP; or
*   CDS.

**4.11** An officer who has been designated by the CO to act as an IA must have reached their operationally functional point and be at least one rank higher than the CAF member subject to the remedial measure.

**4.12** If it is determined on the balance of probabilities that a CAF member has engaged in sexual misconduct or hateful conduct, the CO of the CAF member must consult DMCA 2 prior to initiating any remedial measure.

### Administrative Actions

**4.13** Administrative actions are initiated under applicable regulations, policies, orders, instructions and directives. In addition to the remedial measures set out in this DAOD, administrative actions include:

*   occupational transfer;
*   transfer between sub-components;
*   posting;
*   an offer of terms of service in any case in which an offer has not been made by CAF authorities;
*   reversion in rank; or
*   release or recommendation for release, as applicable.

**4.14** Administrative actions other than remedial measures may be initiated if:

1.  remedial measure has been unsuccessful or breached;
2.  the conduct or performance deficiency is serious enough to warrant such actions; or
3.  the conduct or performance deficiency may be better resolved through such actions.

**4.15** For more information on administrative actions, see section 4 in DAOD 5019-2, _Administrative Review_.

### Administrative Actions Versus Disciplinary Actions

**4.16** Administrative actions are not punishment or sanctions under the _Code of Service Discipline_.

**4.17** Both disciplinary actions under the _Code of Service Discipline_ and administrative actions are meant to address a CAF member’s conduct or performance deficiency. They may operate independently or one may complement the other.

**4.18** Disciplinary actions and administrative actions serve different purposes. Disciplinary actions possess a sanctioning  aspect that administrative actions do not. Disciplinary action is initiated only if there are sufficient grounds to justify the laying of a charge under the _Code of Service Discipline_ against a CAF member.

5\. Requirements for Remedial Measures
--------------------------------------

**Initiation of a Remedial Measure**

**5.1** A remedial measure may be initiated if there is clear and convincing evidence that establishes on a balance of probabilities that a CAF member has demonstrated:

1.  conduct deficiency based on an applicable standard of conduct; or
2.  performance deficiency whereby, over a reasonable period of time, the CAF member has not met the applicable standard of performance.

### Identifying the Deficiency

**5.2** A deficiency must be categorized as a conduct deficiency or a performance deficiency, but not both. Identification of the CAF member’s deficiency serves to focus on the monitoring objectives and to facilitate any staff or third party review of the CAF personnel record.

**5.3** If a CAF member demonstrates different deficiencies at the same time, each deficiency must be dealt with separately. For example, if a CAF member demonstrates a performance deficiency and is involved in drug and alcohol misuse, the IA could initiate an IC for alcohol misconduct, an IC for performance deficiency and C&P for prohibited drug use.

### Determining the Appropriate Action

**5.4** In determining if a remedial measure should be initiated, an IA must consider:

1.  the potential consequences if a remedial measure is not initiated;
2.  whether another administrative action is more appropriate;
3.  whether the conduct or performance deficiency would be more appropriately dealt with through disciplinary action;
4.  the existence of any relevant MEL; and
5.  whether a disclosed disability was a factor in the conduct or performance deficiency.

**5.5** Although there may exist a link between a demonstrated behavioural issue and a disability, a disability does not automatically excuse a CAF member from the requirement to meet the established standards of conduct and performance set out in regulations, codes of conduct, policies, orders, instructions and directives applicable to the CAF member. However, the IA must take the disability and the CAF member’s overall conduct and performance into account and ensure that any remedial measure does not conflict with the CHRA.

### Factors in Selecting a Remedial Measure

**5.6** An IA must consider the following factors before selecting a remedial measure:

1.  the facts of the case, including the significance and impact of the conduct or performance deficiency;
2.  the CAF member’s entire period of service, taking into account the CAF member’s rank, military occupation, experience and position;
3.  any representations made by the CAF member that directly relate to the conduct or performance deficiency;
4.  any conduct or performance appraisal, evaluation or constructive criticism previously received by the CAF member in respect of the deficiency;
5.  any previous deficiency substantially related to the current deficiency of the CAF member and the amount of time that has elapsed between the two (e.g. C&P is more likely to be initiated for a CAF member in respect of whom an RW was initiated six months ago for a related deficiency, than in respect of whom a similar RW was initiated 20 years ago);
6.  the existence of any relevant MEL and disclosed disability, subject to the requirements of the principle of universality of service; and
7.  any other relevant factors in associated policies or orders related to the deficiency.

### Progression of Measures

**5.7** An IA may select an appropriate remedial measure without progressing from IC to RW to C&P. If a CAF member has demonstrated a conduct or performance deficiency, an IA may review the CAF personnel record and determine that other administrative action is warranted. For example, a CAF member whose CAF personnel record contains two ICs and one RW could be considered for further administrative action without C&P being initiated. The determining factor is not the number of measures, but rather the overall character of the CAF member’s service.

**5.8** An IA may, in certain circumstances, initiate an administrative action other than a remedial measure in the absence of any previous remedial measures initiated in respect of the CAF member.

**5.9** A CAF member who is awaiting or undergoing basic officer or recruit training may still be released immediately in accordance with QR&O Chapter 15, _Release_, for a conduct deficiency.

### Number of Measures

**5.10** There is no limit to the number of remedial measures to which a CAF member may be subject at any one time. For example, a CAF member may be subject to IC for a conduct deficiency regarding harassment, RW for a performance deficiency regarding poor workmanship and C&P for a conduct deficiency regarding prohibited drug use, all at the same time.

6\. Procedures for Remedial Measures
------------------------------------

### Description of a Deficiency

**6.1** Adequate detail in describing the conduct or performance deficiency in a remedial measure is required so that the necessary monitoring may occur and the remedial measure may be reviewed meaningfully by staff and third parties who are unfamiliar with the facts that gave rise to the remedial measure.

**6.2** The description of a conduct or performance deficiency must not:

1.  address multiple conduct and performance deficiencies. If a CAF member displays both conduct and performance deficiencies at the same time, at least two separate remedial measures are required (one for the conduct and one for the performance); or
2.  state that a CAF member was charged with, convicted, sentenced, fined or found guilty of an offence; or
3.  state that a CAF member was charged with, found to have committed, or been sanctioned for a service infraction.

**6.3** The following table sets out examples of how to describe a deficiency:

| Case Example | Poor Description | Good Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conduct
 | Sergeant (Sgt) AZ was convicted of stealing.

 | Sgt AZ possessed several items of personal property belonging to other CAF members of the unit. Sgt AZ said the other CAF members asked Sgt AZ to safeguard their property. However, every CAF member reported their property missing and denied giving Sgt AZ permission to possess their property. Sgt AZ's conduct failed to respect the principles and obligations of integrity, honesty and responsibility as set out in Annex A to DAOD 7023-1, _Defence Ethics Programme_.

 |
| Performance

 | Corporal (Cpl) AB failed to dig a trench..

 | While employed during two recent exercises totalling four weeks in the field, Cpl AB continually demonstrated an inability to dig a standard machine-gun trench, despite having been given proper direction and assistance by section and platoon commanders, and ample opportunity to improve.

 |

### Administering an IC or RW

**6.4** The IA must ensure that any IC or RW is administered in a confidential manner. The procedure to administer an IC or RW is as follows:

| Step | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1
 | 

*   The IA must verbally inform the CAF member of their intent to initiate an IC or RW. 

 | 

*   To determine the appropriate form to use, see paragraph 6.7 of this DAOD.

 |
| 2

 | 

*   The IA must provide the CAF member with a verbal synopsis of the information that will be relied upon by the IA to make a decision.

 | 

 |
| 3

 | 

*   The IA must inform the CAF member of their right to make representations to the IA.
*   The IA must provide the CAF member with a reasonable opportunity to respond. The best practice is to provide the IC or RW 24 hours in advance to allow the CAF member an opportunity to raise any concerns.
*   The CAF member must be informed that assistance may be requested from an officer or senior non-commissioned member and that additional time to make representations may be requested. The IA may grant such a request if appropriate in the circumstances.

 | 

*   The IA determines whether the CAF member’s representations, should they wish to make any, will be oral or written, taking into account the seriousness of the deficiency, the experience of the CAF member and any other relevant circumstances the IA considers appropriate.
*   If the IA is not certain if a request is reasonable, the IA may contact their local JAG representative.

 |
| 4 | The IA must receive and consider the CAF member’s representations, if any, and then provide the CAF member with oral reasons for the decision. | 

*   The CAF member is not obligated to make representations.
*   The representations of the CAF member inform the IA as to the decision to:
    *   initiate the IC or RW;
    *   initiate RW instead of IC;
    *   initiate other administrative actions; or
    *   take no further action.

 |
| 5 | 

*   The IA must complete form DND 2826-E, _Remedial Measure_, and then deliver it, or cause it to be delivered, to the CAF member and ensure that the CAF member is briefed on the:
    *   remedial measure initiated and its purpose;
    *   duration of the monitoring period;
    *   action required to overcome the deficiency;
    *   schedule for progress-briefing sessions; and
    *   consequences of failure to overcome the deficiency.

 | 

*   The IA must sign paragraph 7 of the form.
*   The IA or other officer who delivers the form must sign paragraph 8 of the form.
*   The CAF member must sign paragraph 9 of the form.

 |
| 6 | The IA must place a written account of each progress-briefing session in the CAF personnel record. |   |
| 7 | The remedial measure must be formally concluded. | A written summary indicating that the CAF member has overcome the deficiency must be provided to the CAF member and included in the CAF personnel record. |

### Notice of Intent and Initiation of C&P

**6.5** The IA must ensure that any C&P is administered in a confidential manner. The procedure to deliver the NOI and initiate C&P is as follows:

| Step | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1
 | 

*   The IA must complete form DND 2827-E, _Notice of Intent to Initiate Counselling and Probation_, and deliver it, or cause it to be delivered, to the CAF member, informing the CAF member of the following:
    *   the IA’s intention to initiate C&P;
    *   the deficiency for which C&P is being initiated; and
    *   the reasons that support the initiation of C&P.

 | 

*   The IA must sign paragraph 5 of the form.

 |
| 2

 | 

*   The IA must disclose to the CAF member copies of all documents that: 
    *   substantiate the proposed C&P; and
    *   are to be considered before making a final decision.

 | 

 |
| 3

 | 

*   The IA must provide the CAF member with a reasonable opportunity, not less than 48 hours, in which to make written representations to the IA.

 | 

*   A CAF member must be informed that assistance may be requested from an officer or senior non-commissioned member and that additional time to make representations may be requested. The IA may grant such a request if appropriate in the circumstances.

 |
| 4

 | 

*   The IA must consider the CAF member’s representations, if any, and then provide the CAF member with oral reasons for the decision on the most appropriate action.

 | 

*   The representations of the CAF member inform the IA as to the decision to: 
    *   initiate C&P;
    *   initiate IC or RW instead of C&P;
    *   initiate other administrative actions; or
    *   take no further action.

 |
| 5

 | 

*   If the decision is to initiate C&P, the IA must complete form DND 2826-E.

 | 

*   The IA must sign paragraph 7 of the form.
*   The IA or other officer who delivers the form must sign paragraph 8 of the form.
*   The CAF member must sign paragraph 9 of the form.

 |
| 6 | 

*   The IA must place a written account of each progress-briefing session in the CAF personnel record.

 |   |
| 7 | 

*   The remedial measure must be formally concluded.

 | 

*   A written summary indicating that the CAF member has overcome the deficiency must be provided to the CAF member and included in the CAF personnel record.

 |

**Release of Information**

**6.6** The IA must not release information in respect of a remedial measure that would be exempt or excluded under a request made under the _Access to Information Act or the Privacy Act_ (see DAOD 1001-0, _Access to Information_, and DAOD 1002-0, _Personal Information_, for additional information). If there is any doubt as to whether information may be released, the IA must consult with their local JAG representative.

### Selecting the Appropriate Form

**6.7** The following table identifies the appropriate forms to be used when initiating a remedial measure:

| Type of Remedial Measure | Appropriate Form or Forms |
| --- | --- |
| IC or RW
 | 

*   DND 2826-E

 |
| C&P | 

*   DND 2826-E and DND 2827-E

 |

### Delivery of Appropriate Forms and Briefing of the CAF Member

**6.8** When practical, the IA must personally deliver the appropriate forms and brief the CAF member accordingly.

**6.9** In other cases, the IA may direct an officer to personally deliver the appropriate forms and to conduct the briefing with the CAF member on behalf of the IA. The officer who delivers the forms must notify the CAF member that it is being done on behalf of the IA.

### Evading Delivery

**6.10** If a CAF member appears to be evading the delivery of a form required under this DAOD, the IA, or an officer acting on behalf of the IA, may send the form by registered mail to the CAF member.

**6.11** The form sent by registered mail must:

1.  include the date and time scheduled for the CAF member to be briefed on the remedial measure; and
2.  specify that the remedial measure may be administered even if the CAF member fails to appear for the briefing.

**6.12** If the CAF member fails to appear without good reason for the scheduled briefing, the IA, or the officer acting on behalf of the IA, must annotate the IA’s copy of the form that it was sent by registered mail and that the CAF member failed to appear for a briefing, despite having been given the opportunity to do so.

**6.13** The appropriate form must be placed on the CAF personnel record and be considered delivered to the CAF member.

### Official Language

**6.14** All forms dealing with remedial measures, including their delivery and the relevant briefings, must be in the CAF member’s official language of choice.

### Monitoring Period

**6.15** For every remedial measure, a monitoring period must be set. The monitoring period is intended to allow:

1.  the CAF member time to overcome the deficiency; and
2.  time to assess the CAF member’s progress.

**6.16** The monitoring period, in which the CAF member is to be regularly briefed and provided with the necessary leadership and support, is set out in the following table:

| If the CAF member is on ... | **the monitoring period must be for ...** | **Amplification** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
*   IC or RW

 | 

*   a minimum of three months and a maximum of six months.

 | 

*   The IA must set out the monitoring period in the appropriate form.
*   A monitoring period normally begins on the day on which the CAF member is briefed by or on behalf of the IA.
*   When the monitoring period cannot begin immediately, or the monitoring period needs to be suspended (e.g. no regularly scheduled duty period, leave without pay, etc.), the IA may adjust the dates of the monitoring period in the interest of fairness to the CAF member or for service reasons.

 |
| 

*   C&P 

 | 

*   a period of twelve months for any drug misconduct; and
*   a minimum of six months and a maximum of twelve months for any other deficiency. 

 |

7\. Consequences of Remedial Measures
-------------------------------------

### Career Consequences

**7.1** When C&P is initiated, a CAF member’s eligibility for career opportunities is restricted. The following table sets out career consequences resulting from a remedial measure:

|   | is the CAF member still eligible for ... |
| --- | --- |
| If the CAF member is on ... | Promotion? | career courses? | posting or attached posting? | in-service selection plans? | component transfer? |
| IC or RW,
 | Yes

 | Yes

 | Yes

 | No

(subject to Notes 1 and 2)

 | No |
| C&P,

 | No

 | No

(subject to Note 3)

 | No

(subject to Note 4)

 | No | No

 |

**Note 1 –** A CAF member may be eligible for voluntary occupational transfer, compulsory occupational transfer, subsidized education or a commissioning plan if the monitoring period of the remedial measure expires before the annual competition closing date promulgated by CANFORGEN. The CAF member’s unit must send correspondence supporting eligibility to the local PSO. A CAF member on IC on or after the closing date may exceptionally be considered but the local PSO must submit a waiver request to DPGR 4. No selection message will be released until the CAF member’s remedial measure has been concluded or unless approved by DMCPG on a case-by-case basis.

**Note 2 –** A CAF member subject to a COT and a remedial measure can be considered eligible and processed for the COT if the CAF member is on an IC or RW as long as it is determined by the local PSO that the deficiency is assessed as minor and this determination has been confirmed by the local senior PSO or Command PSO, as applicable. If there is any doubt, the case can be submitted to DPGR 4 and discussed with DPGR as the policy holder of COT. If the deficiency is not assessed as minor, COT processing will not start until the remedial measure is concluded. Examples of deficiencies that are not assessed as minor are those involving sexual misconduct, any misconduct that could discredit the CAF or a pattern of behaviour that cumulatively reveals a significant departure from the expected standard of conduct of a CAF member. No COT will occur unless the remedial measure is concluded or the COT is approved by DMCPG on a case-by-case basis.

**Note 3 –** Normally, there will be no restriction on remedial career courses or other training that support a CAF member who is on C&P in overcoming any conduct or performance deficiency. Each situation will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

**Note 4 –** A CAF member on C&P may be eligible for a posting or attached posting for an operational deployment. In any other case, DGMC may determine that the CAF member is eligible for a posting or attached posting on a case-by-case basis.

### Monitoring and Consequential Action

**7.2** The following table describes the action that is required when:

1.  there has been a repeat of the deficiency during or after the monitoring period; or
2.  the monitoring period has been concluded.

| During the monitoring period, if ... | At the end of the monitoring period, if ... | After the monitoring period, if ... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the CAF member demonstrates a repeat of the deficiency ... | the CAF member has overcome the deficiency ... | the CAF member has failed to overcome the deficiency ... | the CAF member demonstrates a repeat of the deficiency ... |
| the IA must:
*   consider whether the incident is serious enough to cancel the remainder of the monitoring period and to initiate a more significant remedial measure or other administrative action; or
*   assess the incident against the CAF member’s overall performance at the end of the monitoring period.

 | 

*   the CAF member must be so informed in writing; and
*   a written summary by the IA must be placed on the CAF member’s CAF personnel record and distributed in accordance with this DAOD.

 | 

*   for which an IC or a RW had been initiated, a more significant remedial measure or administrative action must be initiated.

 | 

*   for which a C&P had been initiated, an AR or other administrative action must be initiated.

**Note –** Administrative action could result in the release of the CAF member

 | 

*   the IA may initiate an AR or other administrative action.

 |

### Reporting on the Personnel Appraisal Report

**7.3** A reporting officer may comment in a performance evaluation report on a CAF member’s conduct or performance deficiency in accordance with the policy set out in DAOD 5059-0, _Performance Appraisal of Canadian Forces Members._

### Grievance

**7.4** A CAF member who believes they have been aggrieved by any decision, act or omission under this DAOD may submit a grievance in accordance with QR&O Chapter 7, _Grievances_.

9\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

**Compliance**

**9.1** CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, CAF members may seek direction through their chain of command. Military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of CAF members with this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**9.2** CAF members are accountable to their military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the CAF as an institution, and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the _Code of Service Discipline_ regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**9.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
