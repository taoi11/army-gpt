### Preliminary Review

**4.4** An officer, or non-commissioned member (NCM) of the rank of sergeant or above, must be designated by the CO to conduct a preliminary review of a report of academic misconduct, including any necessary interviews, to determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that academic conduct has occurred.

2.  if academic misconduct has occurred, one or more recommended administrative actions as appropriate.

**4.10** The person must continue their training and education during the conduct of the PRB.

### Final Decision by CO

**4.11** The CO must consider the PRB's draft decision and make a final decision as to whether academic misconduct has or has not occurred.

**4.12** The CO is not bound by the PRB's draft decision.

**4.13** The CO must provide a copy of the final decision to the person who is the subject of the PRB.

### Administrative Action

**4.14** A CO who decides that academic misconduct has occurred may impose one or more of the administrative actions set out in the _Consequences_ block as appropriate, including concurrently recommending to the Director Military Careers Administration that a CAF member be released.
