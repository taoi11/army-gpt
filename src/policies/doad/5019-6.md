### Preliminary Review

**4.4** An officer, or non-commissioned member (NCM) of the rank of sergeant or above, must be designated by the CO to conduct a preliminary review of a report of academic misconduct, including any necessary interviews, to determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that academic conduct has occurred.

### Subsequent Action by CO

**4.7** The CO must consider the finding from the preliminary review. If the CO determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that academic misconduct has occurred, the CO must:

1.  cause a Progress Review Board (PRB) to be conducted if it is not necessary to proceed under the Code of Service Discipline, and impose any other administrative action in accordance with regulations, other DAODs, orders or instructions for non-academic misconduct if appropriate to do so; or
2.  initiate proceedings under the Code of Service Discipline and impose no further action under this DAOD until the proceedings under the Code of Service Discipline are completed.

1.  a finding as to whether academic misconduct has or has not occurred; and
2.  if academic misconduct has occurred, one or more recommended administrative actions as appropriate.

**4.10** The person must continue their training and education during the conduct of the PRB.

### Final Decision by CO

**4.11** The CO must consider the PRB's draft decision and make a final decision as to whether academic misconduct has or has not occurred.

**4.12** The CO is not bound by the PRB's draft decision.

**4.13** The CO must provide a copy of the final decision to the person who is the subject of the PRB.

### Administrative Action

**4.14** A CO who decides that academic misconduct has occurred may impose one or more of the administrative actions set out in the _Consequences_ block as appropriate, including concurrently recommending to the Director Military Careers Administration that a CAF member be released.

### Senior Authorities

**4.15** The Commander CDA in respect of courses conducted by the CDA, and the commander of a command in respect of courses conducted by the command, may make any decision on academic misconduct and impose any administrative action set out in this DAOD.

### Grievances
