1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2012-10-03

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).

**Supersession:** CFAO 19-4, _Failure to Settle Private Debts_

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Military Career Policy and Grievances (DMCPG)

2\. General Principles
----------------------

### General

**2.1** _Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces_ (QR&O) article 19.07, _Private Debts_, provides that the private debts of a CAF member are the responsibility of the CAF member.

**2.2** A CAF member cannot be ordered to settle private debts.

### Consequences

**2.3** A CAF member's failure to settle private debts may reflect upon their good character and adversely affect:

1.  their conduct and performance;
2.  their security clearance suitability; and
3.  the operational and administrative efficiency of the CAF.

**2.4** Administrative action may be initiated if a CAF member fails to settle private debts.

### Compulsory Payments

**2.5** Under Section 2, _Compulsory Payments_, of QR&O Chapter 207, _Pay Allotments and Compulsory Payments_, only the Chief of the Defence Staff or the commanding officer (CO) may order a compulsory payment, from the pay and allowances of a CAF member, in respect of a financial support order or judgement debt submitted by an applicant. The terms "applicant", "financial support order" and "judgement debt" are set out in QR&O paragraph 207.02(3), _Compulsory Payments – General Provisions_.

**2.6** The CAF must only facilitate the settlement of a CAF member's private debts in accordance with QR&O Chapter 207 and this DAOD.

3\. Procedure
-------------

### Procedure Table

**3.1** The following table sets out the procedure that a CO must follow when correspondence is received that a CAF member has failed to settle a private debt:

| Step Number | Step | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Determination | Upon receipt of correspondence relating to the private debt of a CAF member, the CO must determine, in consultation with the local representative of the Judge Advocate General if required, the nature of the debt.
If the correspondence relates to a financial support order, QR&O article 207.03, _Financial Support Order_, applies.

If the correspondence relates to a judgement debt, QR&O article 207.031, _Garnishee Summons – Judgement Debts_, applies.

If the correspondence concerns a private debt that is not a financial support order or a judgement debt, QR&O Chapter 207 does not apply.

 |
| 2 | Notification to CAF member | After having determined the nature of the private debt, the CO must provide the CAF member with a copy of all correspondence relating to the private debt, including any correspondence in respect of compulsory payments that may be ordered under QR&O Chapter 207. In addition, the CO must inform the CAF member that:

*   private debts are the responsibility of the CAF member; and
*   failure to settle private debts may:
    *   result in administrative action (see DAOD 5019-2, _Administrative Review_, and DAOD 5019-4, _Remedial Measures_); and
    *   affect their security clearance suitability.

 |
| 3 | Correspondence with an applicant or creditor | After the CAF member has been notified in accordance with step 2, the CO must send DAOD Form 5019-8A, _Letter to Creditor_, if a compulsory payment under QR&O Chapter 207 has not been ordered.

If a compulsory payment has been ordered under QR&O article 207.03 or 207.031, the applicant must be so informed.

**Note –** A letter to a creditor or applicant must not contain any personal information about the CAF member.

 |
| 4 | Security review | The CO of the CAF member must, if appropriate:

*   consider, in accordance with paragraph 36.80 of the _National Defence Security Instructions_ (NDSI), any change in personal circumstances of the CAF member;
*   determine if action under paragraph 36.81 of the NDSI is required; and
*   inform the CAF member of any action taken.

 |
| 5 | Financial counselling | The CO must:

*   determine if the CAF member requires financial counselling; and
*   direct the CAF member, if required, to report to the base, wing, unit or Service Income Security Insurance Plan financial counsellor.

 |

### Administrative Action

**3.2** Administrative action may be taken against a CAF member if the CAF member's failure to settle private debts adversely:

1.  has an impact on CAF operational or administrative efficiency.
2.  affects their conduct or performance; and

### CAF Member on Retirement Leave or Released

**3.3** A CO must forward to the Director Military Careers Administration (DMCA) correspondence concerning the private debt of a CAF member who is on retirement leave or who has been released.

**3.4** The DMCA must determine if the person is still a CAF member and take action in accordance with the following table:

| If the person is ... | then the DMCA must ... |
| --- | --- |
| still a CAF member, | handle the complaint in accordance with the _Procedure Table_ in this DAOD. |
| no longer a CAF member, | send a letter to inform the creditor or applicant that the person is no longer a CAF member. |
