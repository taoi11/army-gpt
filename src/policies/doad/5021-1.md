4\. Overview
------------

### General

**4.1** This DAOD shall be read in conjunction with:

1.  CFAO 34-23, _Occupational Health_;
2.  C-87-040-000/MS-001, _DND Respiratory Protection Program_; and
3.  B-GJ-005-311/FP-020, _CF Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defence Tactics, Techniques and Procedures_.

**4.2** The DND RPP was established in accordance with the respiratory protection requirements of:

1.  Part II of the CLC;
2.  the COHSR; and
3.  TBS OSH policies, directives and standards.

**4.3** The DND RPP provides the framework upon which NDHQ groups, commands, bases, wings and units formulate and implement their own specific RPPs.

### Application of the Part II of the CLC

**4.4** Part II of the CLC applies to the following persons, and to CAF members who have direct management or supervisory responsibilities over these persons:

1.  DND employees; and
2.  other persons in or on a defence establishment who are not CAF members.

### Compliance with the _General Safety Program_

**4.5** Unless a departure from the _General Safety Program_ is authorized by a base/wing commander or unit CO in accordance with the _Departure from General Safety Program_ block, all DND employees and CAF members shall comply with the _General Safety Program_, which encompasses all the requirements of:

1.  Part II of the CLC;
2.  the COHSR; and
3.  TBS OSH policies, directives and standards.

### Aim

**4.6** The aim of this DAOD is to protect the health of DND employees, CAF members and other persons in or on any defence establishment who work in hazardous or IDLH atmospheres and to establish a system to protect them when engineering control measures are:

1.  not practicable in the circumstances;
2.  not yet instituted; or
3.  shutdown for maintenance, repair or emergency.

### Scope

**4.7** This DAOD is not applicable to:

1.  respiratory protection against naturally occurring infectious agents (the Surgeon General/DFHP provides guidance in this area);
2.  CAF diving equipment, including CBA, gases, compressors and storage systems utilized for CAF diving purposes, which are subject to programs managed by D Dive Safety and the LCMM for diving systems;
3.  aircraft oxygen systems; or
4.  medical inhalators or resuscitators.

### Role of the NJC, TBS and HC

**4.8** The government as the employer, and public service bargaining agents, work together through the NJC to resolve employment-related problems and establish terms of employment that apply across the public service.

**4.9** In consultation with the NJC, TBS promulgates OSH directives that amplify the COHSR. These directives form part of each Public Service collective agreement. TBS has delegated authority for the administration of the _Public Service Health Program_ to HC.

**4.10** The roles and responsibilities of HC are outlined in TBS OSH directives.

### Departure from the _General Safety Program_

**4.11** A base/wing commander or unit CO may depart from the _General Safety Program_ as it applies to the respiratory protection of CAF members only if a requirement places a serious limitation on the capability to fulfill an operational or training commitment and the following action is taken:

| If … | then the base/wing commander or unit CO shall … |
| --- | --- |
| a base/wing commander or unit CO is considering a departure from the _General Safety Program_, | 
*   employ recognized risk management practices to determine an appropriate course of action.

 |
| a base/wing commander or unit CO authorizes a departure from the _General Safety Program_, | 

*   be prepared to justify the decision.

 |
| a departure from the _General Safety Program_ would be of a continuing nature, | 

*   consult with their medical and safety advisors; and
*   seek approval from the VCDS through the chain of command.

 |

**4.12** A base/wing commander or unit CO shall not depart from the _General Safety Program_ as it applies to the respiratory protection of DND employees or other persons in or on a defence establishment who are not CAF members.

### Departure from the _Nuclear Safety Program_

**4.13** Prior to taking any decision that would be a departure from DAOD 4002-0, _Nuclear Technology Regulation and Control_, DAOD 4002-1, _Nuclear and Ionizing Radiation Safety_ or the NSOD, a base/wing commander or unit CO shall seek the approval of DGNS in accordance with applicable provisions in the NSOD.

### Exposure Standards for CAF Members

**4.14** In certain specific military operational scenarios and environments, the characteristics of the population of CAF members, the nature, duration and types of hazardous exposures, and the relative balance of health risks may differ significantly from those relevant to general Canadian workplace settings and for which national and General Safety Program standards are derived. In such circumstances, the Surgeon General may recommend the application of different exposure standards that are more appropriate to the health protection of CAF members.
