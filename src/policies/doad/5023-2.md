3\. Overview
------------

**Context**

**3.1** CAF members are required to meet the minimum operational standards, including the CMTFE, as set out in DAOD 5023-1, _Minimum Operational Standards Related to Universality of Service_. The purpose of this DAOD is to issue direction for the CMTFE and the FORCE Evaluation. These evaluations demonstrate if CAF members meet the standards of the six common military tasks listed in paragraph 4.1, which are bona fide occupational requirements. The FORCE Evaluation is derived from the CMTFE and is designed to simulate the physical demands and movement patterns of the six common military tasks.

**3.2** The CAF is committed to maintaining operational effectiveness and readiness. CAF members and DND employees who supervise CAF members must support this commitment. Unless restricted by one or more MELs, or precluded by exceptional circumstances described in this DAOD, CAF members must train for and meet the established standards. COs, the CoC and DND employees who supervise CAF members are all responsible for enabling and promoting physical fitness activities, including those linked to the six common military tasks. Training plans specifically designed to prepare for these tasks are available to CAF members through PSP. COs, the CoC and DND employees who supervise CAF members are also responsible to provide diligent support and administrative follow-up action in accordance with this DAOD.

4\. Evaluations
---------------

**Common Military Tasks Fitness Evaluation**

**4.1** The CMTFE consists of the following six common military tasks:

*   escape to cover
*   vehicle extrication
*   picking and digging
*   stretcher carry
*   sandbag fortification
*   picket and wire carry

**FORCE Evaluation**

**4.2** The FORCE Evaluation is the approved predictor of one’s ability to successfully complete the CMTFE. The FORCE Evaluation components are as follows:

*   20 metre rushes
*   sandbag lift
*   intermittent loaded shuttle
*   sandbag drag

**4.3** Procedures for the FORCE Evaluation and the CMTFE are explained in detail in the _FORCE Operations Manual_, the CMTFE _Operations Manual_ and demonstration videos, available on the CFMWS website.

**4.4** CAF members must successfully complete the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE every 365 days unless restricted by one or more MELs, or an exceptional circumstance applies as set out in section 6. Failure to successfully complete the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE will result in the following:

1.  in the case of a member of the Reg F or P Res, administrative action up to and including release; or
2.  in the case of a member of the Supp Res, COATS or CR on attachment or secondment to the Reg F or P Res, administrative action up to and including cessation of their attachment or secondment.

**Note –** A CAF member may be required to successfully complete the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE more frequently than every 365 days if ordered by a CO or a Comd.

5\. Medical Employment Limitations
----------------------------------

**Restricted for an Evaluation by One or More MELs**

**5.1** A CAF member is not required to complete an annual FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE if restricted for the evaluation by the assignment of one or more MELs that:

1.  are temporary, cover the remainder of an annual evaluation period and prevent an evaluation; or
2.  are permanent and prevent an evaluation.

**5.2** The MEL “PT at own pace, time, intensity, duration” or a MEL with similar restrictions on PT does not medically restrict a CAF member from attempting an evaluation. Only a MEL that specifically precludes a CAF member from completing any or all of the CMTFE tasks or the FORCE Evaluation components restricts the CAF member from attempting an evaluation. However, as part of a reconditioning program, a CAF member may practise any portion of the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE within the limits of their MELs. For example, a CAF member with a MEL “unable to lift more than 5 kilograms repetitively” would still be able to practise the sandbag lift technique with less weight.

**5.3** The PSP Reconditioning Program is available to CAF members who are unable to complete the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE due to injury, illness or deconditioning. This can be incorporated as part of a return to duty plan approved under DAOD 5018-4, _Return to Duty Program for Canadian Armed Forces Members_.

**A Temporary MEL or MELS**

**5.4** Any temporary MEL or MELs that prevent the evaluation of a CAF member must be set out by a health care provider using one of the following:

*   CFHIS 317-01, _Medical Disposition Note_
*   form CF 2018, _Medical Disposition Note_
*   form CF 2088, _Notification of Change of Medical Employment Limitations_
*   a note from a physician, in the case of a Res F member who is not entitled to care under QR&O article 34.07, _Entitlement to Medical Care_

**5.5** Following the removal of a MEL, the CO must approve a period of 12 weeks for the CAF member to complete the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE if the evaluation result of the CAF member is expired.

**A Permanent MEL or MELs**

**5.6** If a CAF member has been assessed as restricted by one or more permanent MELs to complete the FORCE Evaluation, the CAF member must successfully complete the CMTFE to demonstrate the ability to meet the minimum standards of the common military tasks listed in paragraph

**5.7** If the CAF member has been assessed as restricted by one or more permanent MELs to complete both the FORCE Evaluation and the CMTFE, the CAF member must be subject to an AR(MEL) by the appropriate authority, in accordance with DAOD 5019-2, _Administrative Review_.

6\. Exceptional Circumstances
-----------------------------

**Release**

**6.1** An annual FORCE Evaluation or CMTFE is not required if a CAF member has submitted a written request for release or a release has been directed by the CAF in accordance with QR&O Chapter 15, _Release_.

**LWOP or ED&T**

**6.2** When a CAF member on LWOP or ED&T returns to duty, the CO must approve a period of 12 weeks for the CAF member to complete the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE if the evaluation result of the CAF member is expired.

**Deployment**

**6.3** A CAF member must have a current successful annual FORCE Evaluation or CMTFE on the day that they commence a deployment. A CAF member whose evaluation result subsequently expires is not required to complete a new evaluation while deployed. If the evaluation of a CAF member expires during a deployment or post-deployment leave, the CO must approve a period of 12 weeks, starting after post-deployment leave, for the CAF member to complete a new evaluation.

7\. Administrative Requirements and Procedures
----------------------------------------------

**Results of an Evaluation**

**7.1** The date and result of every FORCE Evaluation and CMTFE are recorded in the appropriate evaluation form and uploaded to the official administrative system of record.

**Travel**

**7.2** Travel to complete the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE when not available locally must be administered in accordance with CBI Chapter 209, _Transportation and Travelling Expenses_ and the CFTDTI.

**Reporting of Injury, Illness or Death**

**7.3** The reporting of an injury, illness or death arising from training for, undertaking or completing the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE must be made in accordance with:

1.  QR&O article 24.01, _Reporting of Casualties_;
2.  DAOD 2007-1, _General Safety Program_;
3.  DAOD 5018-2, _Report of Injuries and Exposure to Toxic Substances_;
4.  CFAO 24-1, _Casualties – Reporting and Administration_; and
5.  _Employers’ Guide to the Government Employees Compensation Act_, if applicable.

**7.4** A CAF member must report to their CO as soon as practicable any injury or illness arising from training for, undertaking or completing the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE. Form CF 98, _Report of Injury_, _Disease or Illness_ and form DND 663, DND / CAF _Hazardous Occurrence Report_ must be completed in accordance with DAOD 5018-2 and DAOD 2007-1 respectively.

**Claim for Benefit**

**7.5** An injury resulting from training for, undertaking or completing the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE may result in a claim for a VAC benefit or benefit under CBI 211, _Service Benefits for Ill and Injured Members_.

**Note –** The determination of entitlement to a VAC benefit is made by VAC or the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, not by the DND or the CAF.

**7.6** A Res F member on Class “A”, “B” or “C” Reserve Service, who suffers an injury, disease or illness that is attributable to their military service, may also be eligible to apply for benefits under CBI 210.72, _Reserve Force – Compensation During a Period of Injury, Disease or Illness_.

**7.7** A Res F member may also be eligible to claim for benefits under GECA. Benefits in respect of the same injury can only be provided under CBI 210.72 or GECA, not both.

**7.8** Evaluation forms, PSP exercise programs and training logs may be used to assist a CAF member with a claim for a disability or other benefit resulting from a physical fitness training injury as they establish links between fitness training and operational readiness.

8\. Failure to Achieve Evaluation Standards
-------------------------------------------

**Supportive Actions**

**8.1** If a CAF member fails the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE, or fails to attempt either evaluation due to avoidance, the CAF member’s CO must determine, in accordance with DAOD 5019-2 and DAOD 5019-4, _Remedial Measures_, if administrative action is warranted.

**8.2** When remedial measures are applied for a CAF member who fails the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE, a step-by-step process from IC to C&P is applied and usually continues even in the event that a CAF member is later successful. For example, if a CAF member fails an evaluation and is placed on IC, subsequently passes the evaluation and fails again during the subsequent evaluation cycle, the remedial measure to be applied should be an RW. The process in the table to paragraph 8.4 does not usually begin again as it is applied for the same performance deficiency. However, if the reason for the failure is different or the time between failures is significant, starting the process anew may be warranted. A CO may address special circumstances on a case-by-case basis through an AR.

**8.3** A CAF member who fails the FORCE Evaluation or the CMTFE must be placed on an SPTP and be re-evaluated. A CAF member who is placed on an SPTP is normally in this program for a 12-week period and re-evaluated upon completion. Details regarding the SPTP can be obtained through local PSP fitness representatives.

**8.4** The following table sets out the progressive steps to be taken by the CoC for a CAF member who fails to meet the CMTFE standards:

| Step | Current Result | Consequence | Subsequent Action | New Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Did not meet the CMTFE standards by failing the FORCE Evaluation on the 1st attempt. | 
*   Place the CAF member on an SPTP for 12 weeks, normally; and
*   administer an IC, if warranted.

 | Re-evaluate using the FORCE Evaluation. | Pass – Record the result and return within 365 days for the annual evaluation. |
| Fail – go to Step 2.

 |
| 2 | Did not meet the CMTFE standards by failing the FORCE Evaluation on the 2nd attempt. | 

*   Place the CAF member on an SPTP for 12 weeks, normally;
*   schedule the CAF member for the CMTFE; and
*   administer an RW, if warranted. 

 | Re-evaluate using the CMTFE. | Pass – Record the result and return within 365 days for the annual evaluation. |
| Fail – go to Step 3.

 |
| 3 | Did not meet the CMTFE standards by failing the CMTFE on the 1st attempt. | 

*   Place the CAF member on an SPTP for 12 weeks, normally;
*   schedule the CAF member for the CMTFE; and
*   place the CAF member on C&P, if warranted.

 | Re-evaluate using the CMTFE. | Pass – Record the result and return within 365 days for the annual evaluation. |
| Fail – go to Step 4.

 |
| 4 | Did not meet the CMTFE standards by failing the CMTFE on the 2nd attempt. | Reg F or P Res member:

*   CO recommends an AR for performance deficiency.

 | An appropriate authority conducts an AR and renders a decision.

**Note _–_** The failure at this step to meet the CMTFE standards normally results in release.

 | Not applicable |
| Supp Res, COATS or CR member:

*   CO recommends an AR for performance deficiency.

 | An appropriate authority conducts an AR and renders a decision.

**Note _–_** The failure at this step to meet the CMTFE standards normally results in cessation of the attachment or secondment.

 |

**8.5** A CAF member undergoing BMQ or BMOQ training who fails to achieve the CMTFE standards will be managed in accordance with CF Mil Pers Instr 06/09, _Physical Fitness Program for Untrained CF Personnel_.
