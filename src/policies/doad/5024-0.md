2\. Definitions
---------------

**DND living accommodation** (_logements du MDN_)

All residential housing units and furnished quarters administered by the Minister of National Defence except those used for field training or deployed operations. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 43049)

**residential housing unit** (_unité de logement résidentiel_)

Means unfurnished quarters or a leased housing unit administered by the Minister, including a heritage residence that may contain some furnishings. (Article 1.02 of the _Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces_)

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** The DND and the CAF recognize that CAF members experience frequent relocations and separations from the family due to the unique military lifestyle. To mitigate these challenges and enable members to meet the requirements of the CAF, access to DND living accommodations may be offered as a non-permanent option to CAF members serving in Canada.

**3.2** Access to DND living accommodations contributes to:

1.  operational effectiveness;
2.  CAF readiness; and
3.  the morale and welfare of CAF members and their families.

**3.3** Access to DND living accommodations may be offered in support of:

1.  federal government policies;
2.  CAF operational requirements; and
3.  other policies and agreements of the DND and the CAF.

**3.4** DND living accommodations can provide a residential option to support CAF members when they are moved at public expense. However, CAF members are expected to seek options from the local private sector market where the market provides a sufficient supply of living accommodations.

**3.5** This policy does not create an entitlement or benefit for CAF members but rather governs equitable access by CAF members to DND living accommodations as needed, with due consideration for CAF operational requirements.

**3.6** This DAOD is amplified by DAOD 5024-1, _Residential Housing Units and Furnished Quarters,_ as well as the _DND Living Accommodations Instruction_.

### Policy Statement

**3.7** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  enabling equitable access for CAF members to DND living accommodations;
2.  providing appropriate DND living accommodations that support a training, residential or transient need;
3.  administering DND living accommodations with due regard to safety, security, dignity and privacy; and
4.  establishing compensation and benefits policies, plans and programs for CAF members that address the affordability of DND living accommodations as well as supporting CAF members seeking accommodations in the local private sector market.

### Requirements

**3.8** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  manage DND living accommodations in accordance with applicable Treasury Board (TB) guidelines, DND direction and the principles outlined in the National Joint Council’s _Isolated Post and Government Housing Directive_ (IPGHD), except in those cases where TB has approved a need to differ to account for unique military circumstances;
2.  optimize the quantity and type of DND living accommodations, by location;
3.  integrate DND living accommodation policies with other DND programs and plans to ensure coherence in its application;
4.  establish and maintain DND living accommodation standards that are nationally consistent, equitable and appropriate for their intended purpose, whether it be for a training, residential or transient use; and
5.  conduct regular reviews and updates of this policy to ensure its continued relevance.

4\. Consequences
----------------

#### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements, or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channels of communication or chains of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
