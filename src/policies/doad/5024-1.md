3\. Overview
------------

**Purpose**

**3.1** The purpose of this DAOD is to set out the general principles and responsibilities associated with the provision of DND living accommodations, as well as outlining the accommodation standards and program administration of residential housing units (RHUs) and furnished quarters.

**3.2** This DAOD must be read in conjunction with the _DND Living Accommodations Instruction_ which provides additional details.

**Context**

**3.3** To carry out their duty wherever it is needed in Canada, CAF members may be offered access to DND living accommodations as a non-permanent option that supports a training, residential or transient (i.e. temporary) need.

**3.4** Under certain circumstances, in support of DND or CAF requirements, DND employees may also occupy furnished quarters.

**Note 1 –** Any authorized occupant, not subject to this DAOD, is governed by the Canadian Forces Housing Agency (CFHA) Licence to Occupy for RHUs or through the local base/wing standing orders for furnished quarters.

**Note 2 –** In the National Capital Region (NCR), a number of housing units are provided by the Personnel Support Programs (PSP) of the Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services (CFMWS) and managed by the Canadian Forces Support Group (Ottawa-Gatineau) (CFSG(O-G)). These housing units are not governed under this DAOD series nor the _DND Living Accommodations Instruction_. Additional information is available from the local PSP staff or the CFSG(O-G) website as required.

**General Principles**

**3.5** The DND and the CAF are guided by the following principles:

1.  enabling equitable access for CAF members to DND living accommodations while ensuring that prioritization and allocation reflect the operational requirements of the CAF;
2.  providing appropriate DND living accommodations that supports a training, residential or transient need; and
3.  that occupancy in DND living accommodations is voluntary, unless CAF members are required by duty to occupy furnished quarters when ordered by an appropriate authority, for example a training authority.

**3.6** The provision of DND living accommodations for CAF members is guided by federal government policy to ensure that:

1.  shelter charges reflect charges that are similar to those in the local private sector rental market; and
2.  eligibility for DND living accommodations does not constitute an entitlement.

**Access to DND Living Accommodations**

**3.7** Access to DND living accommodations, in line with federal government policies, is primarily offered to CAF members under the following conditions:

1.  furnished quarters are needed for training purposes;
2.  the worksite is at an isolated post, in accordance with Compensation and Benefits Instructions (CBI), Chapter 11, _Isolated Post Instructions_; or
3.  the local private sector market does not provide sufficient accommodations.

**3.8** CAF operational requirements also support access to DND living accommodations when required for a residential purpose. Priority is given to CAF members when there is an operational requirement in support of:

1.  new CAF entrants with less than five years of service being moved at public expense;
2.  CAF members moved at public expense for a course or series of courses; or
3.  CAF members affected by the challenges of the unique military lifestyle such as frequent postings and the obstacles associated with getting re-established.

**3.9** Additionally, other policies and agreements of the DND and the CAF allow access to:

1.  designated residences allocated to identified positions in support of the incumbent’s roles and responsibilities. A designated residence may be:
i. an assigned residence to satisfy unique service requirements of the CAF;

ii. a statutory departmental heritage responsibility; or

iii. both assigned and heritage;

5.  DND living accommodations when there is a need to support formal agreements and arrangements with other nations.

4\. Accommodation Standards
---------------------------

**4.1** DND living accommodations are designed, built and allocated according to their intended purpose as follows:

1.  the CFHA sets the accommodation standards for RHUs based on industry standards and Departmental requirements; and
2.  the CMP sets the accommodation standards for furnished quarters in consultation with the applicable L1 advisors.

5\. Program Administration
--------------------------

**Eligibility and Priority**

**5.1** This policy does not create an entitlement or benefit for CAF members requesting DND living accommodations. It governs equitable access by CAF members to DND living accommodations, as needed, with due consideration for priority based on the CAF operational requirements identified at paragraph 3.8.

**Allocation**

**5.2** The allocation of:

1.  RHUs is based on priority, household size and availability; and
2.  furnished quarters is based on priority, category or type of room and availability.

**Note 1 –** Depending on demand, other factors may be considered in the allocation of DND living accommodations by the appropriate authority.

**Note 2 –** Waitlists are used when the number of applications is greater than the availability of RHUs at a particular location.

**Conditions of occupancy**

**5.3** An occupant must comply with the conditions of occupancy which:

1.  for RHUs are provided by the CFHA in the Licence to Occupy and as outlined in the _DND Living Accommodations Instruction_; and
2.  for furnished quarters are set out in local standing orders with violations treated accordingly.

**Retention of DND Living Accommodations**

**5.4** Due to the non-permanent nature of occupancy in DND living accommodations, an occupant is expected to vacate immediately when a CAF service requirement no longer exists. In specific circumstances, an occupant may be permitted to retain their DND living accommodation for a limited time; for example, retention of a furnished quarter while away on leave or duty, or until relocating to their intended place of residence after release from the CAF.

**Requirement to Vacate, Evacuate or Relocate**

**5.5** An occupant may be required to vacate, evacuate or relocate, in accordance with the table of authorities in DAOD 5024-0, _DND Living Accommodations_.

**5.6** An occupant must not be ordered to vacate or otherwise be removed from DND living accommodations without appropriate notice and authority as specified in this DAOD series, the _DND Living Accommodations Instruction_, and the occupancy agreement.

**Charges for DND Living Accommodations**

**5.7** Charges for:

1.  RHUs are set by the CFHA in accordance with Queens’s Regulations and Orders (QR&O) Appendix 4.1, _Regulations Respecting Charges for Residential Housing Units_ and deducted according to QR&O 208.51, _Deductions for Provision of Residential Housing Units and Covered Residential Parking_; and
2.  furnished quarters are set by the ADM(IE) and deducted according to QR&O 208.50, _Deductions for Provision of Furnished Quarters and Covered Residential Parking_.

**Liability and Insurance**

**5.8** An occupant will be held liable for any financial loss in connection with damage to or loss of public property or any other property that is incurred while occupying DND living accommodations including that which is attributed to the conduct of other household members, pets and invited guests

**Note –** An administrative deduction proposed or ordered does not preclude any further disciplinary action against the CAF member if the chain of command feels it necessary to take such action.

**5.9** An occupant of:

1.  an RHU must have a renter’s insurance coverage that includes personal liability, personal property (contents/belongings) and are strongly encouraged to have additional living expenses coverage; and
2.  furnished quarters may require a renter’s insurance coverage for personal liability, personal property (contents/belongings) and additional living expenses.

**Occupant Complaint Resolution Process**

**5.10** An occupant of DND living accommodations who has a maintenance, administrative or customer service issue that has not been resolved to their satisfaction has the following options in seeking resolution for their complaint:

1.  an occupant of an RHU will refer to the CFHA Complaint Resolution Process outlined in the Licence to Occupy; and
2.  an occupant of furnished quarters will contact the officer in charge of furnished quarters at their location.

6\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

**Compliance**

**6.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**6.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**6.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies; 
2.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
3.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee; 
4.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
5.  the imposition of liability on the part of His Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members. 

**Note –** In respect to the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board (TB) _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
