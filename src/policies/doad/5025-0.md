2.  deputy heads may authorize departmental managers and HROs to make classification decisions.

**Note -** This DAOD does not apply to the occupational groups and levels identified in the following TBS directives:

1.  _Directive on the Administration of Leadership Development Programs - Management Trainee Program and Career Assignment Program_; and
2.  _Directive on Executive (EX) Group Organization and Classification_.

### Policy Statement

**3.3** The DND and the CAF are committed to making classification decisions for all departmental occupational groups and levels in an equitable, consistent, efficient and effective manner in accordance with:

1.  the TBS _Classification System and Delegation of Authority Policy_;
2.  the _Classification System and Delegation of Authority Policy Guidelines_ of the Canada Public Service Agency (CPSA);
3.  the classification standards; and
4.  this DAOD and the DCCO guidelines and bulletins.

### Requirements

**3.4** The DND and the CAF shall:

1.  implement the TBS and CPSA classification system;
2.  ensure reliability and relativity of all classification decisions within the DND;
3.  develop and implement collective work descriptions (CWDs) as the norm;
4.  monitor the classification system to ensure its effective management;
5.  ensure that managers and HROs:
    1.  meet the criteria for delegated classification authority; and
    2.  understand and appropriately apply the _Classification System and Delegation of Authority Policy_, the _Classification System and Delegation of Authority Policy Guidelines_ and the classification standards
6.  establish and maintain a grievance process to effectively handle classification complaints; and
7.  develop and implement departmental policies, plans and programs in respect of the classification of civilian positions.
