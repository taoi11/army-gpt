3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### **Interpretation**

**3.1** In this DAOD:

*   “deployment” refers to the assignment of a DND employee in support of the CAF, and not the transfer of a DND employee from one position to another in accordance with the _Public Service Employment Act_;
*   “force employer” (FE) refers, for most operations and exercises, to the Canadian Joint Operations Command or the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command;
*   “force generator” (FG) refers, for most operations and exercises, to the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Air Force or the Military Personnel Command, as designated by the Chief of the Defence Staff through the Strategic Joint Staff as the responsible organization for the collective training and preparation for a deployment; and
*   “home unit” refers to the organization, before the deployment of a DND employee, in which the substantive position of the DND employee is located.

**3.2** The term “DND employee” is used in this DAOD to include a “DND casual worker” in order to simplify the language in the DAOD. While that is so, this DAOD does not confer any rights or obligations of DND employees under legislation and policies on DND casual workers. Also, while the term “employé du MDN” is used in the French version of this and other DAOD, the term “fonctionnaire” is used in the French version of the _Public Service Employment Act_.

### **Context**

**3.3** DND employees provide essential support to ensure that the CAF has the capabilities it needs to accomplish the missions and tasks assigned by the Government of Canada. To support the CAF, DND employees may need to deploy on:

*   domestic and international operations;
*   exercises in and outside Canada; and
*   technical assistance visits in theatres of international operations, war zones and high-risk areas.

**3.4** This DAOD does not apply to a DND employee who is:

*   on assignment to a position outside Canada in accordance with Section 3.1 of the National Joint Council (NJC) _Foreign Service Directive 3_ – _Application_; or
*   on travel status for a technical support or maintenance trip, such as a mobile repair party, a rest and maintenance period for an Her Majesty’s Canadian Ship _(_HMCS) or a technical assistance visit, to a destination that is not located in a theatre of international operations, a war zone or a high-risk area.

**3.5** This DAOD does not apply to any deployment in support of the CAF of:

*   a non-public fund employee;
*   a Canadian Forces Exchange System (CANEX) employee;
*   a contractor; or
*   a civilian other than a DND employee.

**3.6** DND employees who are deployed in support of the CAF continue to be governed by applicable legislation, collective agreements, policies, instructions and directives. When deployed outside Canada, depending on the specific circumstances and the location of the deployment, DND employees may also be subject to:

*   the _National Defence Act_, including the Code of Service Discipline;
*   the _Criminal Code_; and
*   applicable host nation and international laws.

### **Policy Statement**

**3.7** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  providing a cohesive, coherent and integrated approach to the deployment of DND employees in support of the CAF;
2.  deploying DND employees in support of the CAF only if:
    *   there is an operational need to do so; or
    *   their unique skills are deemed essential;
3.  ensuring that the deployment of DND employees in support of the CAF is voluntary, unless a clear statement has been included in their statement of merit criteria and letter of offer indicating that deployment in support of the CAF is a condition of employment for their DND position;
4.  ensuring the security, health and safety of deployed DND employees;
5.  ensuring that deployed DND employees do not carry weapons; and
6.  ensuring that DND employees are returned to their substantive position upon return from deployment.

### **Requirements**

**3.8** The DND and CAF must:

1.  assess the risks associated with the deployment of DND employees based on the CAF risk management process set out in:
    *   B-GJ-005-500/FP-000, _The Canadian Forces Operational Planning Process_; and
    *   B-GJ-005-502/FP-000, _Risk Management for CF Operations_;
2.  comply with the requirements set out in _Canada Labour Code_ Part II and the NJC _Occupational Health and Safety Directive_, which apply to DND employees at all times, and integrate these requirements into the risk management process;
3.  respect the legislation and the provisions of collective agreements and policies that apply to a deployed DND employee;
4.  ensure that a DND employee hired on a term appointment for a deployment is hired for a term of at least six months and that the term does not expire or is not terminated before the DND employee returns home to Canada;
5.  ensure that a DND casual worker is only deployed under exceptional circumstances, after consultation with and the approval of ADM(HR-Civ);
6.  determine the requirements of a DND employee for a specific deployment, including:
    *   medical and dental fitness;
    *   security clearance;
    *   competencies and skills;
    *   language; and
    *   pre-deployment common training and specialized training;
7.  determine the level of medical capacity available for a deployment outside Canada;
8.  ensure that a DND employee to be deployed outside Canada meets the deployment specific health requirements by being assessed, either through a private health clinic authorized by Health Canada or the DND employee’s private physician, before their deployment and, if required, as soon as practicable after return from a deployment outside Canada;
9.  ensure that a DND employee to be deployed outside Canada meets the requirements for the specific operation or exercise before their deployment;
10.  provide a DND employee with the required pre-deployment common training and specialized training;
11.  brief a DND employee, before their departure from Canada, on Canadian, host nation and international laws that will apply during their deployment outside Canada;
12.  communicate relevant operational orders and administrative instructions to a deployed DND employee, including points of contact at relevant organizations supporting the deployed DND employee;
13.  ensure that a DND employee to be deployed reports directly to a CAF member or DND employee subject to CAF operational command and that the reporting requirement is communicated to the DND employee before their deployment;
14.  review hardship and risk levels with a DND employee before requesting their consent;
15.  ensure that a DND employee freely consents to participate in a deployment unless deployment is a condition of employment for their position;
16.  inform a DND employee of the conditions of their deployment and ensure that the DND employee, before their deployment, understands and signs:
    *   a letter of informed consent; and
    *   a letter of acknowledgement of being briefed;
17.  take all reasonable precautions to ensure the security, health and safety of a deployed DND employee, regardless of their deployment location in or outside Canada;
18.  ensure that a deployed DND employee has a clearly defined role in support of the CAF and Canadian interests;
19.  ensure that a deployed DND employee is provided with work objectives in their Public Service performance agreement in line with the tasks assigned during their deployment and that feedback is provided to their home unit manager to enable performance cycle completion;
20.  ensure that a DND employee who will be deployed in support of international operations receives, to the extent feasible, the same access to medical treatment and the CAF support structure as CAF members; and
21.  establish a post-deployment protocol for reintegrating a DND employee deployed in support of international operations and, if practical, involving them in the reintegration plans for deployed CAF members.

**4\. Consequences**
--------------------

### ****General****

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
