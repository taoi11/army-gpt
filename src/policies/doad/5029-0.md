2.  the _Public Service Employment Regulations_;
3.  policies established by the:
    1.  Public Service Commission;

**2.2** Pursuant to section 15 of the PSEA, the Deputy Minister (DM) of the Department of National Defence has been delegated certain powers and functions, which are set out in the _Appointment Delegation and Accountability Instrument_ (ADAI).

**2.3** The ADAI requires DND to actively monitor, through internal audits and other review measures, the exercise of delegated powers and functions to ensure the integrity of appointments and adherence to appointment values.

**2.4** The _Instrument of Delegation of Human Resources Authorities for Civilian Public Service Employees of National Defence_ sets out the powers and functions sub-delegated by the DM.

### Policy Statement

**2.5** DND is committed to the overarching principle that appointments to and within the public service are:

1.  free from political influence and personal favouritism; and
2.  are based upon merit and the staffing values and principles of:
    1.  fairness;
    2.  access;
    3.  transparency;
    4.  representativeness;
    5.  flexibility; and
    6.  affordability and efficiency.

### Requirements

**2.6** Delegated persons, in the context of an appointment:

1.  shall ensure that any person who is appointed meets the essential qualifications of the position; and
2.  may take into account any:
    1.  qualification held by a person that is considered an asset for the position either currently or in the future; and
    2.  current or future operational requirements and organizational needs.

**2.7** DND and the CAF shall ensure that:

1.  the staffing process is conducted in accordance with the:
    1.  _Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms_;
    2.  _Canadian Human Rights Act_;
    3.  _Official Languages Act_; and
    4.  _Employment Equity Act_;
2.  staffing decisions:
    1.  are made in accordance with applicable legislation, regulations, policies and the DND _Guidelines on Staffing Options_;
    2.  maintain and promote public service values and principles; and
    3.  are based on the DND human resources plans and staffing strategies;
3.  all staffing actions, whether for an indeterminate, term or casual period, reflect the department's commitment to:
    1.  the _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service_;
    2.  DAOD 5015-0, _Workplace Accommodation_; and
    3.  the DND _Directive on the Staffing of Civilian Bilingual Positions_.
4.  all public service employees entitled to a staffing priority are the first to be considered for appointment;
5.  probationary periods provide a fair assessment of newly appointed employees (for further information on probation, refer to the DND _Guidelines for Rejection on Probation_); and
