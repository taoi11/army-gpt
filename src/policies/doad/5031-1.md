4\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Overview

**4.1** CAF training and education standards must be upheld. However, if possible and appropriate, formal recognition should be provided by the CAF for prior learning, i.e. training, education or documented work experience, acquired by:

1.  an applicant seeking enrolment in the CAF; or
2.  a CAF member either prior to or after enrolment, whether or not provided by the CAF.

**4.2** In such cases, duplication of training and education leading to a CAF qualification is avoided and may result in:

1.  reducing the amount of time for military training and education for both the CAF and the CAF member;
2.  reducing the cost necessary to obtain the CAF qualification; and
3.  encouraging the personal and professional development of CAF members through self-development.

### Aim

**4.3** CFMEP facilitates the process of recognizing equivalent non-CAF or CAF prior learning. CFMEP utilizes the PLAR process to achieve this objective.

### PLAR

**4.4** PLAR is the formal process used to evaluate, accept and recognize prior learning.

**4.5** An evaluation is conducted to establish to what extent the prior learning equates to the learning outcomes and standards of current CAF training and education.

**4.6** In some cases the conduct of PLAR may not be organizationally feasible or cost-effective.

### Equivalency

**4.7** Equivalency is defined in the CFITES. The granting of an equivalency for a full or partial CAF qualification is the formal acknowledgment that prior learning is equivalent to the current CAF qualification.

### Advantages of the CFMEP

**4.8** The following table outlines advantages associated with the CFMEP:

| The CFMEP provides … | with … |
| --- | --- |
| recruiting services
 | greater opportunities for attracting and enrolling applicants who already possess the necessary military occupational qualifications or partial qualifications.

 |
| an applicant on enrolment

 | a reduction in the training and educational requirements needed to obtain CAF qualifications.

 |
| CAF members

 | the opportunity for professional development through independent activity.

 |
| MAs and COs

 | alternative approaches to fulfilling training and educational requirements.

 |

### Validation of a Qualification or Granting of an Equivalency

**4.9** Only the IT&E MA may determine the currency and validity of a CAF qualification attained by a CAF member during previous service or may grant an equivalency for non-CAF prior learning to a current CAF qualification.

### Criteria

**4.10** The following non-exhaustive criteria assist the IT&E MA in reaching a decision regarding as to whether or not a CAF qualification attained during previous service is current or valid, or determining if an equivalency for non-CAF prior learning may be granted:

1.  significant increase in skill and knowledge in the specifications;
2.  significant change in an aspect of safety relevant to the standard; or
3.  significant change in the technical aspects of the standard.

5\. Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition
---------------------------------------------

### Initiating the PLAR

**5.1** A PLAR is conducted to save the CAF future training resources.

**5.2** A PLAR is initiated by:

1.  a recruiting center on behalf of an applicant;
2.  a CAF member; or
3.  any person who sees a need for equivalencies that may affect a reasonable number of CAF members.

### Validating or Conducting the PLAR

**5.3** The appropriate IT&E MA normally validates a CAF qualification attained during previous service and conducts the PLAR using CF QS and other training documents as applicable. For example, in the case of out-service training if there is no QS, the applicable occupation specialty specification may be consulted. Information concerning the MAs, and the training for which they are responsible, is set out in DAOD 5031-2, _Individual Training and Education Strategic Framework_ and on the DTEP website.

**5.4** For applicants seeking enrolment in the CAF, if appropriate, a PLAR is conducted by CFRG HQ on behalf of the IT&E MAs using the IT&E MA references supplied. An example is the equivalencies matrix, which is approved by the applicable IT&E MA. If the IT&E MA has not approved an equivalency or individual circumstances are not clear, the PLAR request shall be forwarded to the applicable IT&E MA for guidance and resolution.

### Measuring PLAR Benefits

**5.5** One of the measurable benefits of the CFMEP is savings in the time required to train CAF members, specifically the number of training days identified in a CAF course or qualification training plan. Training days do not include weekends or holidays.

**5.6** The following table sets out the type of training days saved and the measurement criteria:

| Type | is … |
| --- | --- |
| Potential number of training days saved
 | 

*   the total possible number of training days that could be saved if training could flexibly accommodate all identified prior learning and avoid any duplication of training.

For example, if training is provided in a modularized fashion, the potential training days saved could be the number of training days allocated for one module of the training plan.

 |
| Realized number of training days saved

 | 

*   the actual number of training days saved by the training establishments as a result of a full or partial equivalency being granted.

Realized training days saved is only achieved through less time under training.

For example, a CAF member who is excused occasionally from classes, or a section of a course, but who is still taking up a position on that course and graduates at the same time as the co-students, results in no realized training days saved.

 |

**5.7** Organizational realities dictate that, in the interest of efficiency and resource management, it is not always possible to accommodate all requests of individual CAF members. However, any training organization should be constantly looking for ways to benefit the individual CAF members and save CAF resources.

6\. Process for Granting Equivalencies on Enrolment
---------------------------------------------------

### Requesting a PLAR

**6.1** If the prior learning of an applicant seeking enrolment in the CAF could result in the granting of a CAF equivalency, CFRC shall initiate a PLAR request.

**6.2** The following table outlines the process for the PLAR request:

| Who does it? | What happens? |
| --- | --- |
| CFRC
 | 

*   initiates and forwards the PLAR request and supporting documentation to the appropriate IT&E MA through CFRG HQ.

 |
| CFRG HQ

 | 

*   reviews the PLAR request against approved information supplied by the appropriate IT&E MA, such as a matrix of equivalencies, in an effort to expedite processing for the applicant;
*   if previously authorized by the relevant MAs, grants a full or partial equivalency; and
*   if unable to determine a clear equivalency, refers the request for PLAR to the appropriate IT&E MA for guidance and resolution.

 |
| IT&E MA

 | 

*   evaluates the request and determines the equivalency based on an evaluation matrix that is updated with changing CAF training requirements and changing civilian education systems;
*   records the results of the evaluation on the designated CAF ED;

**Note -** The CAF ED is the CAF database that records equivalencies granted by the CAF for CAF qualifications. It also contains equivalencies granted by civilian institutions and organizations for CAF qualifications.

*   forwards the evaluation results to CFRG HQ, including but not limited to, the potential number of training days saved, the realized number of training days saved, and any delta training required (i.e. any additional training that may be required to obtain the CAF qualification); and
*   designs and maintains an up-to-date information matrix of equivalencies for all military occupations for which it has training responsibility and provides that information to  
    CFRG HQ.

 |
| CFRG HQ

 | 

*   informs the CFRC of the results of the PLAR; and
*   following the CAF member's enrolment, the CFRG HQ MASM enters the qualification in HRMS.

 |
| CFRC

 | 

*   informs the applicant of the results of the PLAR and places the information in the CAF member's unit personal file.

 |

### After Graduation from Recruit or Basic Officer Training

**6.3** The following table outlines the normal progression after graduation from recruit or basic officer training:

| A CAF member who has been granted … | shall normally be posted to … | and may be promoted on completion of recruit or basic officer training … |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a partial equivalency
 | a training establishment to complete the remainder of the necessary training or education,

 | 

*   to the appropriate rank by:
    *   CFRG HQ if a Regular Force member; or
    *   the appropriate Reserve Force promotion authority if a Reserve Force member.

 |
| a full equivalency

 | a unit for duty,

 | 

*   up to and including Cpl/LS or Capt/Lt(N), as applicable, retroactive to enrolment, by:
    *   CFRG HQ if a Regular Force member; or
    *   the appropriate Reserve Force promotion authority if a Reserve Force member.

 |

**6.4** Unless otherwise previously authorized by D Mil C, CFRG HQ is responsible for consulting with D Mil C before offering a rank other than Pte(B)/OS(B) or OCdt/NCdt on an enrolment offer to an applicant for the Regular Force or CT. This enables career managers to plan postings accordingly.

7\. Process for Granting Equivalencies to CAF Members
-----------------------------------------------------

### Requesting a PLAR

**7.1** A PLAR is normally conducted if the prior learning of a CAF member, including those on CT, sub-component transfer or occupation transfer, could result in:

1.  a reduction or elimination of future training and education time for progression within the CAF member's military occupation or in a military occupation to which the member is in the process of transferring; or
2.  recognition of a qualification that is useful to future CAF activities, for example, non-occupation specialty specification skills.

**7.2** An equivalency is only granted if the CT, sub-component transfer or occupation transfer is accepted.

**7.3** The following table outlines the process for a PLAR request from a CAF member:

| Who does it? | What happens? |
| --- | --- |
| CAF member
 | 

*   initiates the PLAR request and forwards it with supporting documentation through the chain of command to:
    *   the applicable IT&E MA; or
    *   a CFRC for a CT.

 |
| PSO

 | 

*   provides guidance to CAF members, if required, assisting them to compile and submit a PLAR request.

 |
| IT&E MA

 | 

*   evaluates requests and determines applicable equivalency;
*   records the results of the evaluation including the potential number of training days saved and the actual realized number of training days saved;
*   identifies any delta training that is required;
*   forwards the evaluation results to the CAF member's parent unit, the ECS for CT and sub-component transfers to the Reserve Force, or the CFRG HQ for CT to the Regular Force;
*   if an equivalency is granted, forwards the results to its MASM who includes this data in HRMS;
*   records the results in the CAF ED; and
*   designs and maintains an up-to-date information matrix of equivalencies for all military occupations for which it has responsibility, and provides that information to CFRG HQ, specifically identifying those equivalencies that CFRG HQ may authorize on behalf of the IT&E MA.

 |
| CFRG HQ

 | 

*   acts on behalf of the IT&E MAs, if authorized to do so by the IT&E MA, in cases of CT to the Regular Force for basic and common training, or for training and qualifications related to an applicant's former military occupation if it is different than the military occupation for which the CAF member has applied.

**Note -** CFRG HQ may grant equivalencies if so delegated by the MA to do so based on previously conducted PLARs.

 |
| Parent unit

 | 

*   informs the member of the results of the PLAR;
*   confirms results have been entered in HRMS if an equivalency has been granted; and
*   places the information in the CAF member's unit personal file.
