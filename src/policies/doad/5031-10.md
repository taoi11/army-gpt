1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2003-06-27

**Application:** This is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:** CFAO 9-58, _Adventure Training_

**Approval Authority:** This DAOD is issued under the authority of the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (DCDS).

**Enquiries:** Director Plans, Doctrine and Training (DPDT)/J7 Training 7 (J7 Trg 7)

2\. Overview
------------

### Context

**2.1** Adventure training complements both individual and collective training for CAF members, and provides necessary training and development to support the CAF mission. Adventure training is an integral part of operational training and as such is to:

1.  be planned and executed with proper supervision;
2.  have well defined objectives, with formal orders and instructions; and
3.  contain an element of challenge and risk.

**2.2** Because adventure training requires participation in challenging outdoor pursuits that contain an ever-present risk of injury or death, participants shall have some or all of the qualities of fitness, physical and moral courage, initiative and endurance.

### Aim and Objectives

**2.3** The aim of adventure training is to develop, through challenging outdoor pursuits, leadership and other qualities that enhance the performance of CAF members during times of peace and armed conflict. It should be conducted on an opportunity basis and within available resources.

**2.4** The main objectives of adventure training are to:

1.  provide mental stimulation by exposure to the element of risk;
2.  strengthen mental and physical endurance; and
3.  stimulate initiative and teamwork.

### Adventure Training Activities

**2.5** An expedition is a specific adventure training activity. To gain maximum training value, it should be of at least two-days duration.

**2.6** An international expedition is a specific adventure training activity that takes place outside Canada.

**2.7** The following are recognized adventure training activities:

1.  mountaineering, including rock, snow and ice climbing;
2.  caving;
3.  hiking and trekking in rugged terrain, on foot, bicycle, skis or horseback;
4.  canoeing, kayaking and rafting; and
5.  ocean sailing.

**2.8** Activities that do not qualify as adventure training include:

1.  organized military marches, e.g. the Nijmegen Marches;
2.  humanitarian and charitable projects;
3.  bungee jumping;
4.  dinghy sailing;
5.  bicycle road touring or racing;
6.  downhill skiing;
7.  scuba sports diving (see CFAO 50-10, _Scuba Sports Diving_); and
8.  sports parachuting (see CFAO 50-7, _Sport Parachuting_).

3\. Participation in Adventure Training
---------------------------------------

### Participation

**3.1** Adventure training is intended primarily for CAF members, but foreign military personnel may also participate if approved by the applicable approving authority.

**3.2** Participation by DND and Non Public Funds (NPF) employees is permitted but only if vacancies permit and their participation is not to the detriment of CAF members.

**3.3** Civilian guides may be used when the approving authority considers it appropriate.

### CAF Members

**3.4** Adventure training is organized military training for CAF members.

### Foreign Military Personnel

**3.5** Approving authorities shall determine that foreign military personnel participating in adventure training:

### DND and NPF Employees

**3.6** DND and NPF employees may participate in adventure training if approved by the applicable approving authority. Their involvement shall:

1.  be voluntary;
2.  be fully justified by the expedition leader in the request for the adventure training; and
3.  not compromise the aim or objectives of the expedition.

**3.7** Once DND or NPF employee participation on an adventure training expedition has been authorized, the expedition leader shall ensure that they have:

1.  sought approval from their respective supervisors;
2.  requested leave for the duration of the expedition;
3.  met the same physical standards as for CAF members, including the passing of the Basic Military Swimming Standard Test if the expedition involves water-oriented activities (see CANFORGEN 047/03, _Interim CF Aquatics and Water Safety Policy_);
4.  received a formal brief from the expedition leader on potential dangers;
5.  completed and signed form DAOD 5031-10A, _Release_;
6.  obtained and provided proof of appropriate private insurance coverage; and
7.  provided required next of kin (NOK) details (see Form DND 2587, _Next of Kin (NOK) Identification Form_)

### Cadet Instructor Cadre

**3.8** All adventure training conducted by CAF members of the Cadet Instructor Cadre shall comply with the instructions in this DAOD.

**3.9** Expeditions involving cadets shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable instructions issued by the Director Cadets and Junior Canadian Rangers (D Cdts & JCR).

### Civilian Guides

**3.10** The use of civilian guides, either volunteer or hired, is encouraged:

1.  for adventure training expeditions that are to be conducted in areas unfamiliar to the expedition leaders; or
2.  if the approving authority considers it would enhance safety.

**3.11** Civilian guides may only be authorized to participate in expeditions if they are qualified instructors or safety supervisors. All civilian guides shall:

1.  complete and sign form DAOD 5031-10A, _Release_, prior to their participation; and
2.  provide required NOK details (see Form DND 2587, _Next of Kin (NOK) Identification Form_).

### Insurance Coverage

**3.12** DND and NPF employees and civilian guides shall:

1.  obtain appropriate life, disability and medical insurance coverage to cover the potential risks of participation in an adventure training expedition;
2.  ensure that the insurance coverage is sufficient for any losses or damage that may result from their participation; and
3.  provide proof of such coverage to the expedition leader prior to embarking on the expedition.

4\. General Principles
----------------------

### Composition of an Expedition

**4.1** A chain of command shall be established for each adventure training expedition.

**4.2** Expedition leaders shall be CAF members. The approving authority shall be satisfied that the expedition leader is suitably qualified and experienced to lead the expedition.

**4.3** If the expedition leader does not hold the appropriate technical expertise, qualification or experience, the approving authority is to ensure that the expedition includes CAF members, DND or NPF civilian employees, or civilian guides who have the necessary technical expertise, qualification or experience.

**4.4** Approving authorities shall ensure that the ratio of experienced and qualified personnel to participants meets the Minimum Safety Requirements set out at the DPDT/J7 Trg website.

**4.5** Individuals, whether novice or expert in a specific adventure training activity, should be given equal opportunity to participate in an adventure training expedition, provided applicable safety standards are met.

### Expedition Instructions/Post Expedition Reports

**4.6** Once an expedition is authorized, the expedition leader shall produce a detailed and formal expedition instruction. A suggested format for an expedition instruction is set out at the DPDT/J7 Trg website. The instruction shall contain:

1.  a detailed program, including all pre-expedition training and briefings; and
2.  detailed logistic support issues, especially emergency procedures.

**4.7** On completion of an expedition, the expedition leader shall produce a post-expedition report, a copy of which shall be forwarded to the approving authority. These reports permit approving authorities to maintain oversight of approved adventure training activities and address policy issues as they arise.

### Technical Advice

**4.8** Prior to approving an adventure training expedition, approving authorities should consider seeking technical advice and guidance from either their local Personnel Support Programs (PSP) staff or an appropriate civilian organization.

### Fitness Standard

**4.9** The expedition leader shall ensure that all personnel taking part in an adventure training expedition:

*   have met the CAF Minimum Physical Fitness Standards (MPFS) (see DAOD 5023-2, _Physical Fitness Program_); and
*   have passed the basic Military Swimming Standard Test if the expedition involves water-oriented activities (see CANFORGEN 047/03, _Interim CF Aquatics and Water Safety Policy_).

**4.10** Expedition leaders shall ensure that the degree of difficulty of their expedition is carefully matched to the physical fitness level, experience and proficiency of the participants.

### Safety

**4.11** Safety is to be the priority throughout the planning and execution of an adventure training expedition. Safety considerations minimize the dangers and risk in all expeditions. Approving authorities are to ensure that the Minimum Safety Requirements set out at the DPDT/J7 Trg website are met.

**4.12** During the expedition planning, the expedition leader shall complete a formal risk assessment. The risk assessment is to be included in the adventure training request.

**4.13** No expedition may take place until:

1.  all participants are briefed and, if necessary, trained by qualified instructors to overcome assessed hazards; and
2.  comprehensive emergency procedures are planned.

### Accidents

**4.14** All accidents that occur during an expedition shall be reported in accordance with:

1.  CFAO 24-1, _Casualties - Reporting and Administration_, if casualties have been incurred; and
2.  DAOD 2008-3, _Issue and Crisis Management_.

**4.15** Related media interviews and public announcements shall be made in accordance with DAOD 2008-2, _Media Relations and Public Announcements_.

**4.16** Subsequent investigations into any injury or death incurred during an expedition shall be conducted in accordance with DAOD 7002-0, _Boards of Inquiry and Summary Investigations_.

### First Aid

**4.17** The expedition leader shall ensure that all expedition participants are capable of administering emergency first aid in accordance with the appropriate standards. If necessary, first aid refresher training should be given prior to commencement of the expedition.

5\. Administration
------------------

### Expedition Approval Authority

**5.1** Environmental chiefs of staffs (ECSs) and other group principals are approval authorities for adventure training expeditions conducted within their organizations.

**5.2** Expedition approval authority may be delegated, where considered appropriate, to no lower than unit commanding officers (COs).

**5.3** International expeditions may only be approved by an ECS or other group principal. A copy of the approved expedition instructions for any international expedition shall be forwarded to the DCDS, attention DPDT/J7 Trg 7.

**5.4** Approval authority is provided by the chain of command of the expedition leader.

**5.5** Participants from other commands or units only require permission from their respective chain of command to take part in the expedition.

### Staff Clearances

**5.6** All international expeditions shall have host nation approval and staff clearance. Using the procedures and guidelines in CFAO 20-5, _Temporary Duty - DND Personnel_, the expedition leader shall obtain staff clearance through the Director Protocol and Foreign Liaison 2 (DPFL 2) during expedition planning. Approving authorities shall be satisfied that appropriate staff clearance has been obtained.

**5.7** All international expeditions conducted in the USA, in addition to obtaining staff clearance, are required to comply with the procedures for the notification of cross border movement (see CFAO 20-45, _Temporary Cross-Border Movement of Land Forces between Canada and the United States_).

**5.8** In accordance with CFAO 4-10, _Notification of Military Activities Conducted within Northern Area's Geographical Area of Responsibility_, HQ Canadian Forces Northern Area (CFNA) is to be notified of all expeditions that occur within their area of responsibility.

### Budgetary Support

**5.9** Maximum materiel, transportation and financial support may be given for adventure training, provided it is not at the expense of operational training. Support shall be allocated as part of command and unit budgets, and shall be included in training plans.

**5.10** In addition to command and unit financial support, voluntary contribution of funds or loan of equipment by participants is encouraged. The expedition leader shall inspect and ensure that equipment loaned by participants or other third parties:

1.  meets all applicable safety standards;
2.  is in satisfactory condition; and
3.  is appropriate for the expedition.

**5.11** Providing that the approving authority determines that there is no conflict of interest (see DAOD 7021-0, _Conflict of Interest and Post Employment_), commercial sponsorship should be considered, particularly for major expeditions.

### Reports

**5.12** DCDS reports annually to Armed Forces Council (AFC) on all CAF adventure training expeditions.

**5.13** By 30 April of each year, approval authorities shall submit a report to DPDT/J7 Trg 7 summarizing all adventure training expeditions completed during the past fiscal year and all planned for the current fiscal year. The report for each adventure training expedition shall include the expedition:

1.  name;
2.  dates;
3.  location;
4.  type, e.g., mountain climbing, trekking, canoeing, etc.;
5.  composition of participants, including rank structure;
6.  assessment of success or failure;
7.  difficulties, if any; and
8.  recommendations.
