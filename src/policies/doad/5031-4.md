1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2002-09-05

**Date of Modification:** 2004-12-22

**Application:** This is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:** CFAO 56-20, _Second Career Assistance Network Program_

**Approval Authority:** This DAOD is issued under the authority of the Director Training and Education Policy (DTEP).

**Enquiries:** DTEP

2\. Overview
------------

### Transition to Civilian Life

**2.1** In the transition of CAF members from military to civilian life, the CAF recognizes the importance of offering assistance to Regular Force members, full-time Reservists and, in certain cases, their spouses or common-law partners. The transition may involve counselling, education and accreditation for a career change. It is also in the interest of the CAF to train, educate and upgrade CAF members for second careers.

**2.2** Recognizing the commitment of CAF members and the extraordinary demands and challenges of the military lifestyle, the CAF makes services available in the Second Career Assistance Network Program (SCAN) to assist in the transition to civilian life. SCAN is an activity under DAOD 5031-0, _Learning and Professional Development._

### Access to SCAN Services

**2.3** CAF members should access SCAN early and periodically during their careers. They are strongly encouraged not to wait until their last year of service to take advantage of SCAN services.

3\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### General

**3.1** CAF members may access SCAN services, subject to availability and relevance to their career transition needs. The Long Term Planning (LTP) seminar and the transition seminar are also available to spouses or common-law partners of CAF members. CAF members have priority to attend SCAN seminars, but once attendance of a spouse or common-law partner is confirmed, they are not to be displaced.

### Eligibility

**3.2** Some SCAN services are available to all CAF members, while others may be offered only to those who are making the transition to civilian life. The intent is to offer individual transition assistance as well as counselling services to each CAF member. Funds available for SCAN services are based on departmental financial and spending allocations.

**3.3** Should demand surpass the number of seats available at SCAN seminars and workshops, base/wing personnel selection officers (B/WPSO) must determine how to accommodate the greatest number of people.

### Eligibility Table

**3.4** Eligibility for SCAN services is set out in the following table:

| SCAN services are available to … | subject to … |
| --- | --- |
| 
*   Regular Force members; and
*   full-time Reserve Force members

 | 

*   relevance to the career transition needs of the CAF member; and
*   availability of services.

 |
| 

*   spouses or common-law partners of the above CAF members for the LTP and transition seminars only,

 | 

*   the availability of resources.

 |

4\. Services Offered
--------------------

### General

**4.1** Each B/WPSO makes available SCAN services to CAF members within their primary and supported locations. The purposes of the principal SCAN services are set in the following table.

| The purpose of the … | is to provide … |
| --- | --- |
| LTP seminar
 | CAF members with the opportunity to engage in long-term planning as it relates to their education, career, transition and retirement goals. LTP seminars must cover the following subjects:

*   financial planning, including budget planning, house purchase and mortgages;
*   wills and estates;
*   disability pensions and other related benefits administered by Veterans Affairs Canada;
*   Service Income Security Insurance Plan (SISIP) benefits; and
*   career development and transition.

 |
| transition seminar

 | generalized information on major transition subjects. Transition seminars must cover the following subjects:

*   career transition services;
*   administration procedures on release;
*   disability pensions;
*   support of injured members;
*   SISIP Coverage After Release; and
*   financial benefits at release.

**Note -** In certain locations, the subjects in the LTP and transition seminars are covered by other forums, e.g., "le salon Multi-défis" at Valcartier. In such cases, the above requirements are considered to have been met.

 |
| counselling

 | CAF members with the opportunity to:

*   address their concerns in regard to transition;
*   assess their knowledge, skills, qualifications and experience relative to their transition goals; and
*   make recommendations in order to assist them to form a plan that can be implemented to meet their transition goals.

 |
| career transition workshops

 | competency-based training in job search, with workshops in the four key areas of:

*   self-assessment for interests and skills;
*   résumé writing;
*   job searching; and
*   interview techniques.

 |
| interest inventory

 | CAF members with the opportunity to complete an interest inventory. This service is aimed primarily at the CAF member. However, if the B/WPSO believes that administering the inventory to spouses and common-law partners may better assist CAF members in making the transition to civilian life, and the service is not available in the community, the B/WPSO may administer the inventory to spouses and common-law partners of CAF members.

 |
| reference material library

 | CAF members with easy access to this resource. Canadian content is encouraged. As a minimum each library must hold current information on the following subjects:

*   self-assessment for interest and skills;
*   résumé writing;
*   job searching; and
*   interview techniques.

Access to the Internet must also be provided wherever possible and feasible.

 |
| job bank and talent bank

 | potential employers with a chance to advertise job opportunities for CAF members and provide CAF members with the opportunity to post their résumés for the perusal of prospective employers. These two data banks may be viewed at the Canadian Defence Academy (CDA) website. The B/WPSO can provide the current CDA website address. Résumés and job opportunities are normally posted for a fixed period of time, but CAF members and prospective employers have the option to modify the time period.

 |

5\. SCAN Process
----------------

### Process Table

**5.1** The following table describes the SCAN process normally followed during a military career.

| CAF members should attend … | When? |
| --- | --- |
