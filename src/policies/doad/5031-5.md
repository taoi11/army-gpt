3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The CAF is committed to promoting continuing education for CAF members. The importance of continuing education in the CAF is reflected in the wide availability of various programs and services developed to meet CAF goals and personal goals. Continuing education, on a part-time basis, is made available via the CFCEP, designed as a self-development activity under DAOD 5031-8, _Canadian Forces Professional Development_.

**3.2** CAF members may enhance educational level and skills under the CFCEP while they serve and, if applicable, prepare for transition to civilian life.

### Aim

**3.3** The aim of the CFCEP is to facilitate access to post-secondary educational services.

4\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Access to CFCEP

**4.1** The CFCEP is primarily designed to assist CAF members.

**4.2** Access to the services offered by academic institutions may also be provided to former CAF members, the members of families of CAF members and to DND employees, in order to permit them to achieve personal and professional learning goals by enabling them to upgrade academic qualifications.

### Other Institutions

**4.3** CFCEP facilitates access to services for the purpose of upgrading post-secondary academic credentials. CAF members may also take courses or training toward a high school diploma or equivalent, such as GED, or take courses at:

1.  professional institutions;
2.  commercial institutions; or
3.  technical institutions.

### Negotiated Agreements

**4.4** The CDA negotiates agreements at the university and college level with English and French academic institutions. The purpose of these agreements is:

1.  to provide easy access to post-secondary education for CAF members, and
2.  to establish, in some cases, a CAF education coordinator at the institution to facilitate access.
