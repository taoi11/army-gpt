3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The DND is committed to fostering a culture where learning, whether formal or informal, is encouraged, supported, rewarded and recognized as a sound business investment. The DND is further committed to supporting the learning and professional development (LPD) of DND employees at all levels by planning and providing access to quality programs, services and opportunities for LPD.

### Purpose

**3.2** The purpose of this DAOD is to set out the instructions necessary for the implementation of DAOD 5031-0, _Learning and Professional Development_, and the management of LPD for all DND employees. This DAOD is in line with, and in support of, Government of Canada (GC) and DND people-management initiatives, including employee engagement, retention, renewal and workforce excellence.

### Objectives

**3.3** The objectives of this DAOD are to:

1.  establish the governance and management framework for LPD for DND employees;
2.  provide senior management, managers and supervisors of DND employees, LPD providers and DND employees with strategic direction and clear guidance in relation to their responsibilities pertaining to LPD;
3.  support GC and DND accountability expectations for LPD;
4.  provide performance measurement criteria; and
5.  support the DND in becoming a learning organization and an employer of choice.

### Conflict with Other Instruments

**3.4** If a provision in a collective agreement, memorandum of agreement, letter of understanding or other similar instrument conflicts with this DAOD, that provision prevails to the extent of the conflict with this DAOD.

4\. Governance and Management Framework
---------------------------------------

### LPD Functional Direction

**4.1** Given the assignment to the ADM(HR-Civ) of the functional area of DND employee human resources management, the ADM(HR-Civ) sets out functional direction for the LPD of DND employees in this DAOD, in addition to several directives related to this functional area. To ensure that LPD goals and priorities are achieved, the ADM(HR-Civ) directs that LPD be managed according to the principles of the Civilian _Learning and Professional Development Management Framework_. The strategic oversight, guidance, integration, monitoring and management support of LPD for DND employees has been delegated by the ADM(HR-Civ) to the DGWD.

### LPD Governance

**4.2** LPD governance is exercised through the following strategic committees that advise and guide the ADM(HR-Civ):

1.  Civilian Workforce Management Board (CWMB);
2.  Civilian Human Resource Management Committee (CHRMC); and
3.  Regional Human Resources Planning and Coordination Committees.

### Corporate LPD

**4.3** Corporate LPD to achieve DND goals is:

1.  national in scope and has a DND impact;
2.  related to the essential knowledge and competencies established by the GC and the DND; and
3.  designed to meet GC policy and DND requirements.

### LPD Funding

**4.4** Each level one (L1) advisor must identify, in their business and human resources plans, the intended LPD investment levels for DND employees for their organization.

### Management of LPD Activities

**4.5** LPD for DND employees should take place primarily in the workplace through informal and formal LPD options and be supplemented with higher education if required.

**4.6** LPD for DND employees should be varied, timely, flexible, appropriate and compatible with individual learning styles and adult learning principles. Based on organizational business priorities and individual needs, LPD should be relevant, cost-effective and performance-oriented to facilitate the application of knowledge and skills on the job.

**4.7** In order to provide the most appropriate training options, the use of contemporary and effective LPD methodologies and technologies, whether internally or externally provided, must be considered to meet the LPD needs of DND employees.

**4.8** Should the use of external providers be considered, any contracting must be done in conjunction with the contracting procedures in place governing DND employees taking training with private companies or schools (see section 3.2.7.2, _Training for DND Employees and CAF Members_, of the _Procurement Administration Manual_).

### LPD Delivery

**4.9** The ADM(HR-Civ) encourages the delivery of standardized training and education for LPD, using multimedia and technologies as preferred delivery methods wherever appropriate.

**4.10** LPD providers must adhere to the guides and standards for DND Instructional System Design (ISD) when developing online or classroom-based training (see the _ISD Guides, Standards and Tools_ link on the ADM(HR-Civ) intranet site).

### LPD Approval Authorities

**4.11** The LPD and labour relations sections of the _Instrument of Delegation of Human Resources Authorities for Civilian Public Service Employees of National Defence_ must be consulted to ensure that the proper authorities approve LPD-related requests.

5\. Learning and Development Plans
----------------------------------

**5.1** In accordance with the Treasury Board _Directive on Performance Management_, and DAOD 5006-1, _Performance Management Program for Employees_ (interim), a learning and development plan for each DND employee is an integral part of the Performance Management Program.

**5.2** All DND employees must have a meaningful learning and development plan. The learning and development plan must include information on DND employee learning requirements that are directly linked to organizational and individual performance objectives and professional development.

**5.3** Students employed in the DND through Co-operative Education Program (CO-OP) placements or the Federal Student Work Experience Program (FSWEP) may also have a learning and development plan to develop the necessary skills and knowledge required in order to meet the objectives through their on-the-job learning work experience in the DND.

### Learning and Development Plan Content

**5.4** In addition to applicable GC required training, mandatory DND courses, leadership development activities and second language training, as appropriate, the primary focus of a learning and development plan is to address the following LPD needs that are linked to the performance of a DND employee at work:

1.  operational requirements, current priorities and future organizational needs;
2.  the performance agreement of the DND employee;
3.  work objectives;
4.  knowledge and competency gaps;
5.  individual learning objectives; and
6.  where appropriate, career learning aspirations.

**5.5** It is recommended that a DND employee and their manager consider a variety of LPD activities. The options for the LPD chosen must meet the learning needs of the DND employee and be at the same time operationally feasible. To be considered, an LPD activity must aim to enhance individual and organizational performance and result in defined and measurable outcomes. LPD activities must meet the following criteria:

1.  be intended to satisfy the LPD needs of the DND employee;
2.  be aligned with DND business priorities and organizational goals;
3.  include measurable, observable and specific objectives;
4.  be planned, adequately funded, provided and evaluated; and
5.  be assigned a Human Resources Management System (HRMS) training code.

**5.6** More detailed information on learning and development plans and associated responsibilities may be found in the _DND Guide to Developing Learning and Development Plans (LDPs) – Section “D” of the Public Service Performance Agreement_.

### Learning Activities

**5.7** Learning is an ongoing process in the DND that consists of a broad range of activities, including:

1.  formal learning;
2.  informal learning; and
3.  collaborative or social learning.

### Formal Learning

**5.8** Formal learning is the systematic design and transfer of work-related skills, knowledge and competencies. It consists of hierarchically structured education or school systems and includes organized programs created on the job for technical and professional training. A training institution sets and controls the learning objectives and goals of formal learning activities to produce defined learning outcomes, i.e. university or college courses (classroom-based or online), courses on the Defence Learning Network (DLN) and structured on-the-job programs.

### Informal Learning

**5.9** Informal learning is the transfer of skills, knowledge and competencies that occurs mainly from daily experience in the context of work performance, with objectives identified by an individual or group in response to a perceived need. It includes activities that range from being ad hoc and simple (e.g. work-related discussions, reading and research), to those with more complex objectives, structures and delivery methods (e.g. lunch-and-learn sessions, job shadowing, conferences, and acting and stretch assignments).

### Collaborative or Social Learning

**5.10** Collaborative or social learning is the knowledge creation and sharing that occurs through dialogue and collaboration, often facilitated via communications and media technology (e.g. GCPedia, GCForum, SharePoint, wikis, blogs, etc).

### Formal Education

**5.11** The DND recognizes the importance of formal education and supports education leave and tuition reimbursement as methods of addressing both DND requirements and individual career and learning aspirations, when appropriate.

**5.12** DND employees and their managers should consult education leave policies in CPAO 9.03, _Training Courses Taken Outside Normal Working Hours – Reimbursement of Tuition Fees_, and CPAO 9.05, _Education Leave_, for applicable conditions.

### Professional Development

**5.13** Professional development includes coaching arrangements, participation in the DND Mentoring Program or other developmental programs, acting appointments, assignments, secondments, job shadowing, job sharing, job exchanges, courses offered by recognized academic or external providers or the employer, as well as seminars, conferences, technical or vocational programs and workshops. These activities should also be included in a learning and development plan.

6\. Performance Measurement, Tracking, Monitoring and Reporting
---------------------------------------------------------------

### LPD Performance Measurement

**6.1** The performance measurement of LPD for DND employees must be conducted to ensure that:

1.  LPD is integrated with human resources and other business processes;
2.  LPD is aligned with federal public service, DND or L1 advisor business requirements;
3.  organizations collaborate towards the strengthening of a learning culture;
4.  a diverse range of LPD options is provided;
5.  organizations have adequate funding for planned LPD;
6.  LPD is managed effectively;
7.  the application of newly acquired skills is supported in the workplace; and
8.  LPD has defined and measurable outcomes.

**6.2** The ADM(HR-Civ) provides the _Civilian Learning and Professional Development Evaluation Framework_ and the _Civilian Learning and Professional Development Evaluation Toolkit_ to help build and strengthen evaluation capability within the DND. The Framework provides broad guidance to L1 advisors with respect to evaluating LPD programs and courses taken by DND employees.

### Tracking

**6.3** The HRMS is the DND system of record to capture DND employee LPD data, including costs, and must be used by all L1 advisors to record all completed learning and development plans.

### Monitoring and Reporting

**6.4** The DGWD must identify appropriate reporting mechanisms and specify the information required to monitor LPD effectiveness and compliance with this DAOD.

7\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**7.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant considerations.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
