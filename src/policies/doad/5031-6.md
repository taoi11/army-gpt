3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The CAF is committed to ensuring that CAF members receive recognition for their military education, training and experience that are transferable to the civilian sector.

**3.2** The CAF recognizes the importance of this recognition by having military education, training and experience evaluated so it may be given civilian recognition in the form of full or partial credits or qualifications.

**3.3** The MCTAP provides civilian recognition and therefore supports self-development activity under DAOD 5031-8, _Canadian Forces Professional Development_.

### MCTAP Aim

**3.4** The aim of the MCTAP is to assist CAF members in career transition by providing, if possible, some form of civilian equivalency by the accreditation of all military occupations.

### Accreditation

**3.5** Accreditation is the formal evaluation by a competent civilian professional body of military education, training, experience, course documentation, instructional staff qualifications and facilities, for the purpose of establishing civilian academic, professional or occupational equivalencies.

### Equivalencies

**3.6** Equivalencies can:

1.  result in CAF members obtaining advanced standing at academic institutions; and
2.  assist CAF members in some cases to take civilian certification exams and, once certification is obtained, to practice in a given civilian occupation.

4\. Accreditation
-----------------

### Yearly Review

**4.1** Each year the CDA in consultation with the MAs, identifies military occupations requiring accreditation or re-accreditation. The CDA contracts with the appropriate civilian accrediting organization to carry out the accreditation.

**4.2** The goal is to have a minimum of 20 accreditations completed yearly.

**4.3** The equivalencies resulting from the accreditation are entered by CDA into the CFED that is available for viewing on the CDA website.

### Advanced Standing, Certification and Designation

**4.4** The awarding of advanced standing, full certification or professional designation is not always possible. In certain cases, once full or partial recognition of military education, training and experience has been established, the CAF member may qualify for testing, the results of which could lead to advanced standing, certification or professional designation.

### Compliance

**4.5** CAF members are required to comply with all applicable regulations and orders in respect of any civilian employment in which they may engage. A list of the more pertinent regulations and orders is set out in the References map, but the list is not exhaustive.

### Civilian Accrediting Organizations

**4.6** The following table identifies the civilian organizations that conduct accreditation:

| Accreditation conducted by … | including … | recognize equivalent military training and experience toward … |
| --- | --- | --- |
| academic organizations,
 | universities, colleges and technical schools,

 | academic credits.

 |
| occupational organizations,

 | government agencies, professional associations and international, federal and provincial bodies,

 | obtaining certification, licensing or professional designation.

 |

**4.7** Some of the common and frequently used accrediting organizations can be found on the CDA website, along with a list of the military occupations for which accreditation has been completed.

5\. Process
-----------

### Process Table

**5.1** The following table outlines the process for a CAF member to seek advanced standing, certification or professional designation:

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1
 | Identify all military education, training and experience that may be applied toward a civilian academic program, occupation or profession.

 |
| 2

 | Search the CFED for available civilian equivalency information in the appropriate occupational area, using military occupation or common training.

 |
| 3

 | Contact the B/WPSO or the B/WEO about the potential civilian equivalencies if advice is required.

 |
| 4

 | Provide the required information regarding military education, training and work experience to seek:

*   advanced standing from an academic organization. The academic organization normally requires a PLA to examine the training and skills of the CAF member. It will then grant credits as appropriate towards a particular program. Some institutions may require registration into one of their programs before evaluating the file of a CAF member; or
*   certification or professional designation from an occupational organization. The organization determines the level of the potential certification or professional designation.

 |
| 5

 | Upon receipt of the results as to civilian equivalencies, contact the B/WPSO or B/WEO if assistance is required in making a plan to achieve goals. Include an ILP, if applicable, if the reimbursement of fees is requested.

**Note -** The ILP is available on the CDA website.

 |
| 6

 | If necessary, complete remaining requirements for certification or professional designation

**Note -** The CAF is not responsible for providing training to meet the remaining requirements.

 |
| 7

 | If applicable, obtain certification or apply for an examination for licensing.

 |

### Financial Assistance

**5.2** Eligible CAF members may be entitled to the reimbursement of fees incurred to obtain advanced standing, certification or professional designation, under the conditions set out in:

1.  CBI 210.802, _Skills Completion Program - Regular Force_; and
2.  ADM(HR-Mil) Instruction 17/04, _Education Reimbursement for the Regular Force_.
