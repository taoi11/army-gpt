1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2000-09-13

**Application:** This is an order that applies to officers of the Canadian ArmedForces (CAF), Regular Force.

**Supersession:** CFAO 9-40, _University Training Plan - Officers_

**Approval Authority:** This DAOD is issued under the authority of the Director Training and Education Policy (DTEP).

**Enquiries:**

*   Director Training and Education Policy (DTEP) (policy)
*   Director Military Careers (D Mil C) (programme administration)

2\. Overview
------------

### General

**2.1** Education is an integral part of officer professional development and the CAF encourages officers to pursue continuing education on their own volition.

**2.2** The CAF has established a goal to have all officers, with the exception of those commissioned from the ranks, hold a university degree. In support of this goal, the CAF has established a programme to provide subsidized education to eligible officers in pursuit of their initial baccalaureate degree.

**2.3** This DAOD outlines the conditions and benefits associated with this programme. It does not preclude other initiatives that have been put in place in support of continuing education.

3\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Eligibility

**3.1** To be eligible for subsidized education under this DAOD, officers must:

1.  not be medically restricted;
2.  not hold a baccalaureate or higher degree;
3.  be serving in the Regular Force and have served for at least three years after becoming qualified in their current military occupation;
4.  demonstrate a commitment to educational upgrading;
5.  normally be able to obtain a baccalaureate within a maximum of 16 months of full-time academic training by attending class or through distance education;
6.  be admissible to a Canadian university or the Canadian Forces Military College (CFMC); and
7.  have sufficient time remaining in their current terms of service to complete any previously incurred obligatory service plus that required after subsidized education under this DAOD. If not, then a change to the terms of service may be administered in accordance with DAOD 5049-1, _Obligatory Service_.

**Notes -**

1.  This DAOD does not provide subsidized education for a second baccalaureate or higher degree.
2.  Officers who have previously failed, or withdrawn from, a full-time university programme subsidized by the CAF may be reconsidered under this DAOD (see the section entitled, "Failure or Early Withdrawal").

### Selection Board

**3.2** Director General Military Careers (DGMC) will appoint the selection board annually to meet during the September - February timeframe.

### General Principles

**3.3** Officers selected for subsidized education under this DAOD:

1.  may not deviate from the course plan or change universities without prior approval from D Mil C;
2.  may be authorized by D Mil C to attend summer school;
3.  will be assigned by D Mil C to regular duty during recesses, if not attending summer school between semesters; and
4.  will be returned to normal duties following graduation.

### Leave

**3.4** Officers shall submit leave requests to the applicable unit administrative staff or to the CFMC, as applicable, for approval.

**3.5** D Mil C must be advised of any leave granted to an officer during the period of subsidized education under this DAOD.

### Failure or Early Withdrawal

**3.6** Officers who fail an academic year or semester of subsidized education will:

1.  normally be returned to regular duty; and
2.  incur obligatory service in accordance with DAOD 5049-1, _Obligatory Service_.

**3.7** Officers who have failed, or withdrawn from, a full-time subsidized university programme may apply:

1.  to D Mil C for permission to repeat an academic year or semester at their own expense on leave without pay (LWOP) in accordance with A-PP-005-LVE/AG-001, _Canadian Forces Leave Policy Manual_; or
2.  to be reconsidered for subsidized education under this DAOD if they meet the eligibility criteria and are recommended by their commanding officer (CO).

**3.8** The recommendation by a CO should:

1.  clearly indicate improved motivation, experience and maturity on the part of the officer; and
2.  be supported by documentary evidence of enhanced educational qualifications.

**3.9** Subject to military requirements and on the recommendation of the university or CFMC, as appropriate, D Mil C may grant permission for an officer to repeat an academic year or semester of subsidized education under this DAOD if the academic failure or withdrawal was beyond the control of the officer, or was a result of military requirements.Upon successful completion of an academic year or semester that was repeated at the expense of the officer, D Mil C may approve reinstatement of subsidized education under this DAOD.
