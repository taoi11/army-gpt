4\. Framework
-------------

### The CFPDS

**4.1** The CFPDS is a comprehensive, integrated and sequential development system that provides a continuous learning environment to develop and enhance the capabilities and leadership of CAF members.

**4.2** The CFPDS consists of the following four pillars:

| Pillar | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Education
 | The provision of a base of knowledge and intellectual skills upon which information can be correctly interpreted and sound judgement exercised.

 |
| Training

 | The provision of skills, knowledge and attitudes required to perform assigned duties.

 |
| Employment experience

 | The application and continued development of the skills, knowledge and attitudes acquired through training, education and self-development in the performance of assigned roles and duties, especially in operations and command.

 |
| Self-development

 | Self-initiated, professionally or personally oriented learning, normally done during off-duty time.

 |

**4.3** The core of the CFPDS consists of:

1.  a framework of policies, instructions, guidelines and specifications; and
2.  a development timeframe structure that facilitates the timely and effective PD of CAF members.

**4.4** The IT&E components of the CFPDS are more fully described in DAOD 5031-2, _Individual Training and Education Strategic Framework_.

### Objectives

**4.5** The CFPDS is designed to:

1.  ensure that CAF members meet the applicable requirements identified in the MES specifications;
2.  ensure that CAF members are capable of critical thinking, managing change, effective leadership and resource management, across the full spectrum of military service;
3.  strengthen understanding of the military profession;
4.  enhance general, environmental and military occupation expertise;
5.  enable CAF members to develop professional competencies and attitudes required to successfully perform their duties and tasks;
6.  prepare CAF members for the demands of a progressive career; and
7.  prepare retiring CF members for transition to civilian life.

### Professional Competencies

**4.6** The CAF consider knowledge, skills, abilities and other personal qualities as professional competencies that:

1.  underlie effective or successful job performance;
2.  are observable and measurable; and
3.  are distinguishable between CAF members who perform at superior versus average levels.

### Guiding Principles

**4.7** The CAF is committed to:

1.  providing CAF members with PD throughout their military careers; and
2.  promoting a continuous learning environment, with a view to imparting new knowledge and developing skills and attitudes as the basis for innovation and judgement.

**4.8** PD is a shared responsibility between commanders and commanding officers on one hand, and individual CAF members on the other hand.

**4.9** As bilingualism is intrinsic to CAF leadership, ability in both official languages becomes increasingly important for progression through the DPs.

### Access to the CFPDS

**4.10** Access to the CFPDS is provided, as appropriate and practicable, through:

1.  full-time and part-time options;
2.  in-service, out-service and alternative training delivery;
3.  prior learning assessment and recognition; and
4.  a variety of instructional strategies, learning methodologies and technologies.

### Allocated Duty Time for IT&E

**4.11** A CAF member must be allocated duty time for required IT&E without causing an increase in normal duty hours or a decrease in off-duty time.

**4.12** Normal duty time is that which is typical for the position of the CAF member and the unit situation.

**4.13** Required IT&E includes courses, programmes and qualifications identified in applicable regulations, orders and instructions, that are obligatory for a CAF member to maintain or advance military occupation or professional skills and knowledge.

### Self-Development

**4.14** CAF members engaged in self-development, including IT&E for which they were not formally or centrally selected or were not mandated to take, must normally conduct these studies during off-duty time. If warranted, a CAF member undergoing academic advancement, as part of their self-development, may be authorized special leave (academic advancement), subject to DAOD 5060-0, _Leave_, and its references.

5\. Canadian Forces Professional Development System
---------------------------------------------------

### Leader Framework

**5.1** The leader framework in A-PA-005-000/AP-006, _Leadership in the Canadian Forces: Leading the Institution_, describes the changing leadership requirements of CAF members as they progress in rank and responsibility. The leader framework encompasses the following elements:

1.  expertise;
2.  cognitive capacities;
3.  social capacities;
4.  change capacities; and
5.  professional ideology.

**5.2** The leader framework outlines how a leader's growth from DP 1 to DP 5 involves a change in leadership focus from leading individuals to leading an organization.

### The GSs

**5.3** The OGS and the NCMGS describe the common performance and PD requirements for CAF members.

**5.4** The GS common portion incorporates the leader framework, which indicates the related competencies for each requirement.

**5.5** Performance requirements are organized into the following four categories:

1.  lead military operations;
2.  lead organizations;
3.  lead people; and
4.  lead through the application of professional competencies.

**5.6** Portions of the GS unique to the different ECs identify those duties, tasks and competencies of all CAF members employed in the sea, land or air environment and for CAF members in military occupations managed by those ECs.

**5.7** See the DGPR intranet site for access to the OGS, NCMGS, military occupation and specialty specifications.

### MES Specifications

**5.8** The MES specifications are the foundation of the CFPDS. These specifications are policy and quality control documents that identify the functions, working conditions and tasks for general, environmental, military occupation and specialty capabilities of CAF members.

### The DPs

**5.9** A DP is a timeframe in a career during which a CAF member is trained, employed and given the opportunity to develop specific military occupation or professional skills and knowledge.

**5.10** DPs are distinguished by a progressive increase in the levels of accountability, responsibility, authority, competency, military leadership ability and the knowledge of operations.

### The QLs

**5.11** QLs are the levels of skill and knowledge specified for individual military occupations in the A-PD-055 series of publications.

6\. Officer Professional Development
------------------------------------

### Officer DPs

**6.1** In the OGS, the career of an officer is divided into five DPs. The following table shows the DPs, the associated ranks and common officer qualifications for the Reg F and P Res:

| DP | Rank | Common Officer Qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DP 1 | OCdt/NCdt  
2Lt/A/SLt  
Capt/Lt(N) (Note 1) | BMOQ (common)  
BMOQ (with exemptions) (Note 2) |
| DP 2 | 2Lt/A/SLt (Note 3)  
Lt/SLt  
Capt/Lt(N) | junior officer QL1  
junior officer QL2 |
| DP 3 | Maj/LCdr  
LCol/Cdr | intermediate officer qualification |
| DP 4 | Col/Capt(N) | advanced officer qualification |
| DP 5 | general/flag-officer | senior officer qualification |
| **Note 1 –** An officer progresses from DP 1 to DP 2 upon achieving the applicable OFP. For some military occupations and entry plans, DP 1 may not be completed until the rank of Capt/Lt(N). The OFP occurs when an officer completes all qualifications required for their first employment in the military occupation. At that point, an officer is posted off the basic training list or subsidized university training list to a trained effective strength position. The OFP for each military occupation is contained in the military occupation specification maintained by the DPGR.
**Note 2 –** A separate BMOQ is provided for an officer belonging to a military occupation with exemptions for specific tasks in the OGS.

**Note 3 –** For some military occupations and entry plans, an officer may achieve OFP at the 2Lt/A/SLt rank and thus progress to DP 2 at that rank.

 |

The OFP for each military occupation is contained in the military occupation specification maintained by the DPGR.

**7.2** For P Res QLs it is necessary to use the Reg F QL nomenclature. If differences exist between a Reg F and P Res qualification, the qualification must be preceded with the wording "P Res" (e.g. P Res QL3, P Res QL5A). If there is no difference, the Reg F QL must be used.
