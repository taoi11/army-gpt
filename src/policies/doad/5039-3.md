4\. Overview
------------

### Context

**4.1** The OLA provides that English and French are the OLs of Canada and confirms their equal status within federal institutions. Part VII of the OLA focuses on the duties and responsibilities of the Government of Canada with regard to the advancement of English and French. Subsection 41(1) specifically sets out the commitments of the Government of Canada to:

1.  enhance the vitality of OLMCs in Canada, and support and assist their development; and
2.  foster the full recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian society.

**4.2** Subsection 41(2) of the OLA provides that every federal institution has the duty to ensure that positive measures are taken for the implementation of the commitments set out in subsection 41(1). Section 42 of the OLA provides that the Minister of Canadian Heritage, in consultation with other ministers of the Crown, must encourage and promote a coordinated approach by federal institutions to the implementation of the commitments.

**4.3** Any measure contributing to the development of OLMCs, and to the fostering of full recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian society, constitutes a positive measure. By remaining attentive to the needs of OLMCs and by demonstrating leadership, the DND and the CAF are more capable of identifying positive measures.

### Purpose

**4.4** The purpose of this DAOD is to set the conditions under which the DND and the CAF will meet the commitments of the Government of Canada under Part VII of the OLA.

### Stakeholders

**4.5** The following are the DND and CAF stakeholders responsible for taking positive measures to implement the commitments set out in subsection 41(1) of the OLA:

1.  L1s;
2.  Comds and COs;
3.  DND managers; and
4.  DND employees and CAF members responsible for the development, modification or cancellation of policies and programs.

5\. Process
-----------

**5.1** The DND and CAF OL champions and functional authorities are responsible for the strategic-level implementation of the DND and CAF OL Program, including compliance with Part VII of the OLA.

**5.2** The DOL, on behalf of the DND and CAF OL champions and functional authorities, provides guidance and trains L1 COLs so that they can support their L1 in fulfilling the obligations under Part VII.

**5.3** All DND and CAF stakeholders must ascertain, plan, implement and report on positive measures to fulfill their obligations under Part VII in accordance with the DOL _Framework for the Implementation of Part VII of the OLA_.

### Enhancing the Vitality of OLMCs in Canada and Supporting and Assisting their Development

**5.4** With bases and wings in various regions across Canada, the DND and the CAF have a unique opportunity to support OLMCs and enhance the vitality of both OLs in each region. In order to determine positive measures, it is critical to maintain communications with OLMCs to understand their needs and concerns.

**5.5** Interactions with OLMCs will be conducted in one of two ways, depending on whether the organization is located in the NCR or elsewhere in Canada:

1.  within the NCR, DOL coordinates interaction with the OLMCs; and
2.  outside the NCR, base and wing representatives meet with OLMC representatives.

**5.6** The following are examples of positive measures that enhance the vitality of OLMCs in Canada and support and assist their development:

1.  conducting events that give CAF members and their families the opportunity to become involved with local OLMCs;
2.  publishing directories of services and programs available to CAF members and their families in the minority language (e.g. local doctors and dentists); and
3.  involving OLMC representatives in base and wing “open house” events to provide outreach to CAF members and their families.

### Fostering the Full Recognition and Use of Both OLs in Canadian Society

**5.7** The promotion of both OLs within Canadian society is an obligation of all DND and CAF organizations. Organizations must take the opportunity to use both OLs when addressing the public domestically or internationally. All organizations of the DND and the CAF are involved in events that provide the opportunity to promote both OLs. Each year, the DND and the CAF organize promotional events within Canada and internationally where there is opportunity to promote Canadian culture and English and French in Canadian society.

**5.8** The DND and the CAF also participate in events at the regional and national levels, as well as events of a similar scope led by other government institutions. The promotion of both OLs must be integrated within these events.

**5.9** The following are examples of positive measures that foster the full recognition and use of both OLs in Canadian society:

1.  addresses, announcements and other communications to the general public that are provided in both OLs;
2.  base or wing events that are open to the general public to celebrate the minority language culture;
3.  base or wing theatres that are open to the general public to offer movies in the minority language; and
4.  support by CAF members for Remembrance Day and Veterans’ Week events at local English and French schools

6\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

### Compliance

**6.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**6.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non‑compliance with this DAOD may result in administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee, and administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member. Non‑compliance may also result in the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect to the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
