4\. Overview
------------

### Context

**4.1** Training and education are designed to promote the development of the knowledge, expertise, confidence, judgment and sense of accomplishment of CAF members by encouraging active participation and shared responsibility for learning. As such, training and education are an integral part of the career of every CAF member and a requirement for advancement.

**Note ‚Äì** In the CAF context, training and education consist of IT&E, CT, GPT and professional development courses outside of the IT&E framework.

**4.2** The extent to which CAF members understand the content of training and education provided has a direct impact on their safety and job performance, which in turn contributes to determining their suitability for employment and advancement.

**4.3** Accordingly, in the circumstances as set out in section 5 of this DAOD, the CAF is committed to ensuring that CAF members receive IT&E in the OL of their choice, regardless of where they are serving.

### Purpose

**4.4** This DAOD outlines the procedures governing the OL in which training and education must be offered and delivered to CAF members.

5\. Individual Training and Education in Both Official Languages
----------------------------------------------------------------

### General Principles

**5.1** As the CAF is subject to the _Official Languages Act_, IT&E must be provided to CAF members in the OL of their choice to promote equal career opportunities and optimize course success rates.

**5.2** CAF members may take IT&E in the OL of their choice, regardless of their FOL recorded in Guardian. Accordingly, prior to attending IT&E activities, CAF members must identify their preferred language of instruction in Guardian. CAF members who decide to take a course in their SOL will not be provided with SOL assistance and will be responsible for the outcome of their IT&E.

**5.3** The following are not valid reasons to delay or impede the right of CAF members to receive IT&E in the OL of their choice:

1.  limited resources;
2.  administrative inconvenience;
3.  limited in- or out-service capacity; or
4.  geographic location.

**Note ‚Äì** The above are valid reasons if IT&E in both OLs is similarly delayed.

**5.4** IT&E is considered available in both OLs if:

1.  all IT&E instructional materials, examinations and tools developed or acquired by the CAF, or produced on behalf of the CAF by a third party, are available in both OLs and are of equal quality; and
2.  the IT&E is offered and delivered in each OL by instructors with a minimum linguistic profile of CBC in the language of instruction.

**5.5** IT&E can also be offered in a bilingual manner. IT&E for a course is considered bilingual when:

1.  instructors are bilingual with a minimum linguistic profile of CBC;
2.  students are bilingual with a minimum linguistic profile of BBB;
3.  all materials required for the course, including examinations, homework, presentations, briefings from guest speakers, assessment tools, and training and learning aids are available in both OLs and are of equal quality; and
4.  the course is delivered in both OLs in similar proportions.

### Availability of Instructional Materials, Examinations and Tools

**5.6** COs of IT&E establishments must ensure that instructional materials, examinations and tools, including electronic systems, developed or acquired by the CAF, or produced on behalf of the CAF by a third party, are available to CAF members in both OLs and are of equal quality.

### Alternative Training Arrangements

**5.7** COs of IT&E establishments who are unable to provide IT&E in both OLs using their own resources must seek outsourcing, or a combination of in- and out-training sources, to ensure the delivery of IT&E to CAF members in both OLs.

### IT&E Outsourced Abroad

**5.8** When it is necessary to outsource training abroad because it is not available in Canada, TAs and DTAs must strive to make it available in both OLs. When that is not possible, the minimum SOL proficiency requirement must be clearly publicized so that candidates can receive SOL training ahead of time and achieve the appropriate linguistic profile, if required.

### International Conventions

**5.9** Exceptionally, advanced training for certain occupational career courses governed by international conventions dealing with communication safety may be offered in English only. Career managers, TAs and DTAs must ensure that candidates have achieved an SOL competency level that allows them to fully assimilate the advanced training. Linguistic assistance must be provided to CAF members if required.

**5.10** When occupational career courses governed by international conventions dealing with communication safety are offered in English only, linguistic assistance must be provided as follows:

1.  an experienced instructor proficient in both OLs must be available during class to answer in French any questions that result from language as opposed to actual content; and
2.  key terminology and examination questions must be available in both OLs and be of equal quality, even though examination questions must be answered in English only.

**5.11** To determine if an occupational career course meets the OL requirements of international conventions dealing with communication safety, TAs and DTAs must formally apply, through their L1, to CPCC. DOL will conduct a full assessment of the application, request a legal review and provide CPCC with a recommendation. CPCC‚Äôs decision will then be communicated to the L1 who has applied, and DOL will update the exemptions list as required.

### Courses Under Development

**5.12** Course material for any course under development must be available in both OLs before the course is delivered.

6\. Training and Education in the Language of Work
--------------------------------------------------

### Collective Training

**6.1** CT differs from IT&E in that CT:

1.  is designed to prepare teams, units and other elements to perform military tasks in accordance with defined standards; and
2.  includes procedural drills and the practical application of doctrines, plans and procedures to acquire and maintain tactical, operational and strategic capabilities.

**6.2** CT is delivered in the language of work of the unit. Pre-deployment training is delivered in the language of work of the unit to be deployed.

### General Purpose Training

**6.3** GPT enables CAF members to meet goals mandated by the Government of Canada, the DND, the CAF or an L1 that are not based on a general, environmental, military occupational or specialty specification. Examples of GPT are courses on harassment prevention, health and safety, and office automation. GPT is usually conducted in the language of work of the unit. However, efforts must be made, to the fullest extent possible, to provide GPT to CAF members in both OLs.

### Other Courses

**6.4** Professional development courses outside of the IT&E framework that do not lead to a CAF qualification and are for personal development are usually offered in the language of work of the unit.

### Online Training

**6.5** Online training that the CAF mandates or provides must always be offered in both OLs.

7\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

### Compliance

**7.1** CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, CAF members may seek direction through their chain of command. Military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of CAF members with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**7.2** CAF members are accountable to their military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may result in administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for CAF members. Non-compliance may also result in the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada and CAF members.
