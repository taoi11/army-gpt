3\. Definitions
---------------

**individual training and education** (_instruction individuelle et éducation_)

IT&E has the same meaning as in A-P9-050-000/PT-001, _Manual of Individual Training and Education_, Volume 1, _Introduction/Description_.

**official language** (_langue officielle_)

OL means either the English or French language.

**second official language** (_seconde langue officielle_)

SOL means the OL in which a CAF member is generally less proficient.

4\. Overview
------------

### Context

**4.1** SOLET is an important component of IT&E. The CAF provides SOLET and learning retention opportunities as well as language testing in order for CAF members to:

1.  exercise leadership in both OLs;
2.  meet the language requirements of their duties and functions;
3.  fulfill current and future CAF operational requirements; and
4.  improve or maintain their SOL proficiency

### Purpose

**4.2** This DAOD:

1.  outlines the SOLET management framework;
2.  provides the principles regarding access by CAF members to SOLET programmes;
3.  outlines SOLET options;
4.  summarizes the SOLET monitoring and reporting requirements; and
5.  identifies key responsibilities.

5\. Management Framework
------------------------

### Military Second Language Training Programme

**5.1** The MSLTP provides CAF members with SOLET and learning retention opportunities, in and out of classroom settings, for the purpose of general and work-related language proficiency development. The MSLTP focuses on:

1.  oral comprehension;
2.  oral expression;
3.  reading comprehension; and
4.  written expression.

### SOL Proficiency

**5.2** SOL proficiency is a core requirement for many CAF members to advance in their careers. SOL proficiency is integrated with other competencies recognized in organizational development and appraisal systems. Therefore, the responsibility for SOLET and the retention of SOL proficiency is shared by CAF members and the CAF to ensure that investments in SOLET are optimized.

**5.3** The CAF shall use only the PSC SOLE to determine the SOL proficiency of CAF members. The PSC SOLE linguistic profile summarizes SOL proficiency for each of the three language skills of:

1.  reading;
2.  writing; and
3.  oral interaction.

### Accommodation

**5.4** If a CAF member has a disability which may hinder learning their SOL, but the CAF member otherwise meets the minimum operational standards related to universality of service, the CDA shall direct that necessary steps be taken to adapt the teaching methods and other teaching approaches, as well as scheduling, duration of training, training-related evaluation processes, premises and materials, in order to accommodate the needs of the CAF member.

6\. Access to Second Official Language Education and Training
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Access to SOLET

**6.1** Access to SOLET is based on OLA imperatives and CAF operational requirements. These imperatives and requirements shall be prioritized by the ECSs and the DOL on an annual basis.

### SOLET Outside Canada

**6.2** Subject to the availability of resources, CAF members working outside Canada shall have access to SOLET. Priority is provided to CAF members who are required to fulfill their present or future duties and functions or other CAF operational requirements in both OLs.

### Reservists

**6.3** Subject to the availability of resources, the ECSs shall authorize access to SOLET for CAF members of the Reserve Force required to meet OLA imperatives or fulfill their duties and functions or other CAF operational requirements in both OLs.

### Officer Cadets at a Royal Military College

**6.4** As part of their core requirements, officer cadets who are enrolled in the Regular Officer Training Plan and serve at a Royal Military College shall be provided with SOLET.

### Other Officer Cadets

**6.5** Other officer cadets shall have access to SOLET in accordance with the CAF annual priorities.

7\. Second Official Language Education and Training Options
-----------------------------------------------------------

### SOLET Options

**7.1** SOLET shall be offered on a full- or part-time basis, either:

1.  in a classroom;
2.  by distance learning in a self-paced environment; or
3.  through a combination of different resources, activities or programmes.

**7.2** CAF members who are not selected for full-time SOLET in a given year may register for distance learning and online courses. These courses are designed to offer self-study opportunities to CAF members who are self-motivated and desire to advance the learning of their SOL.

### SOL Retention and Developmental Programmes and Activities

**7.3** The CAF shall ensure that access to SOL retention and developmental opportunities are supported, whether it is for CAF members returning from language training or those CAF members who are seeking SOLET opportunities. The choice of course media and course availability vary according to available resources, priorities and guidance established by the ECSs and the DOL on an annual basis.

**7.4** CAF members should actively seek SOLET-related opportunities in order to improve or maintain their level of SOL proficiency. CAF members may contact the CDA through their chain of command to find out what resources are available for them. CAF members shall prepare and submit a SOLET ILP if required by their commanding officer or supervisor. An electronic ILP is available on the CDA website.

**7.5** CAF members seeking SOLET for developmental purposes leading to testing of their SOL proficiency shall develop and submit a SOLET ILP through their chain of command for CDA endorsement.

### SOLET Reimbursement

**7.6** To obtain pre-approval for the reimbursement of SOLET expenses, a CAF member shall:

1.  consult with their base or wing PSO as necessary to confirm that the institution, course or programme has been evaluated and deemed, in accordance with DOL SOLET specifications, to be an approved institution, course or programme;
2.  complete the ILP and submit it to the PSO for review; and
3.  be notified when the ILP is approved, by either the PSO or the CDA based on the level of funding requested by the CAF member, and receive a copy of the approved ILP.

**7.7** To obtain reimbursement of expenses for any new course set out in an amended ILP, the amended ILP shall be submitted for approval prior to the commencement of the course.

**7.8** The CDA shall be notified through the PSO if a CAF member is not completing a course listed in their ILP.

**7.9** Reimbursement shall not be provided for courses completed prior to the approval of the ILP.
