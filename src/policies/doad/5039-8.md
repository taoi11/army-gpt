4\. Overview
------------

### Context

**4.1** The CAF is subject to the application of the OLA, and participates in various activities and operations for which a capability in both English and French is expected and required.

**4.2** To meet statutory obligations and operational commitments, the CAF requires linguistically qualified CAF members.

**4.3** To ensure the accurate and uniform evaluation of the SOL capability of CAF members, their SOL proficiency level must be assessed using certification testing.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/5000-series/5039/5039-8-canadian-armed-forces-second-official-language-certification-testing.html#wb-tphp)

5\. Certification Testing
-------------------------

### The PSC SLE

**5.1** The PSC SLE is the only SOL certification testing instrument currently accredited and used by the CAF to assess the SOL proficiency level of CAF members.

**5.2** The SLE is the property of the PSC, and CAF access is authorized under MOUs negotiated with the PSC. The MOU terms for use of the SLE must be strictly followed and respected by the CAF and all CAF-contracted third parties.

### Skills Tested

**5.3** The SLE is comprised of three tests as set out in the following table:

| The test of ‚Ä¶ | evaluates a CAF member's ‚Ä¶ |
| --- | --- |
| reading comprehension | ability to understand text written in their SOL. |
| written expression | writing ability, i.e. the knowledge of grammar, structure, usage and other aspects of written expression necessary to perform writing tasks dealing with work-related situations in their SOL. |
| oral proficiency | ability to both speak in their SOL and understand others speaking in that language. |

### Proficiency Levels

**5.4** Certification testing assesses three general levels of proficiency:

*   A (elementary);
*   B (intermediate); and
*   C (advanced).

**5.5** The qualification standards describing A, B and C for each skill are set out in the Treasury Board _Qualification Standards, Section 3: Qualification Standards in Relation to Official Languages_.

### SOL Profile

**5.6** The SOL profile is a compound code composed of three characters, one for each skill:

1.  the first character refers to the reading skill;
2.  the second character refers to the writing skill; and
3.  the third character refers to the oral proficiency skill.

**5.7** As each skill or test is independent of the others, test results or linguistic requirements can be different for each of the skills. For example, the SOL profile ‚ÄúCAA‚Äù indicates the attainment of, or requirement for, an advanced proficiency level in reading, and an elementary level in writing and oral proficiency.

**5.8** The characters used in SOL profiles are:

1.  A, B and C, representing levels of proficiency;
2.  X, indicating that the performance of a CAF member on the test did not meet the minimum requirements of level A for the particular skill;
3.  dash ‚Äú ‚Äì ‚Äù, indicating that a CAF member has not been tested, or need not be, for this particular skill; and
4.  E, indicating that the performance of a CAF member on the test is such that the CAF member can be expected to maintain indefinitely their proficiency at level C. The CAF member is therefore exempted from further testing for this skill. Thus, although the E exemption rating is not a proficiency level in itself, it is considered to represent a proficiency level as it represents the attainment of a permanent capability at level C.

### Periods of Validity

**5.9** The SLE test results of CAF members are valid for the following periods:

1.  5 years for levels A, B or C; and
2.  indefinitely for the E exemption rating.

**5.10** The latest SLE test result supersedes any existing result, even in cases where the previous result was superior to the new one, or was still valid.

**5.11** The validity periods do not apply to the SOL profile, but rather to each of the SLE test results (A, B, C or E). As each of the three skills may be tested on a different date, the validity period of each may be different.

**Note** ‚Äì CAF members who attained an E for ‚Äúexemption‚Äù prior to October 1995 were not tested by the PSC. Accordingly, this E is only valid within the CAF for as long as the person remains a CAF member and is not retested. If a CAF member is retested, paragraph 5.10 will apply.

6\. Administration
------------------

### Testing Eligibility Criteria

**6.1** CAF members are eligible for SLE testing as set out in the following table:

| Component | A CAF member is eligible for SLE if ‚Ä¶ |
| --- | --- |
| Reg F | 
*   the CAF member has never been tested with the SLE, and a request is made by the CO or career manager, in consultation with the local COL;
*   their SLE results have expired;
*   their SLE results will expire:
    *   within 12 months; or
    *   during their posting outside of Canada or participation in an operation outside of Canada, or immediately after their return to Canada. In such a case, testing of the CAF member must occur prior to their departure from Canada;
*   attending an MSLTP course that leads to certification, if referred by the CAF language training delivery establishment; or
*   their SOL ability has improved due to a significant learning event, e.g. formal training, or formal or informal immersion, such as everyday contact with the SOL environment or speakers.

**Note** ‚Äì A CAF member must contact their local COL to have the significance of an event validated by a staff officer responsible for language training at a CAF language training delivery establishment.

 |
| Res F | 

*   applying for a CAF position that has a SOL proficiency requirement, if referred by the selection committee as part of the competitive staffing and manning process;
*   already holding such a position but has SLE results that have expired or will expire within 12 months;
*   attending an MSLTP course that leads to certification and the CAF member is referred by the CAF language training delivery establishment; or
*   identified by their chain of command, career manager or branch advisor, for reasons tied to military employment structure specifications or succession planning requirements.

 |
| **Note** ‚Äì The condition requiring CAF members to have a valid result of A on both the reading and writing tests as a prerequisite for oral proficiency testing is no longer in effect. |

### Testing Eligibility Restrictions

**6.2** Certification testing is normally provided only within Canada. However, a CAF member posted, attached posted or on temporary duty to an OUTCAN established position, i.e. not participating in an operation, may be tested at that location if it is set up to do so in accordance with PSC policies.

**6.3** A CAF member who has obtained an X for a particular skill must not be retested for that skill unless the request is justified, e.g. following SOLET or a significant learning event.

### Registration

**6.4** The first point of contact for a CAF member to request SLE is their local COL.

**6.5** In the case of a CAF member on an MSLTP course leading to SLE, registration must be done by the CAF language training delivery establishment.

### Request for Review

**6.6** A CAF member who believes that their performance on an SLE test was unfairly assessed or negatively affected by unfavourable testing conditions, and who can provide supporting evidence or statements to that effect, may request a review. The request must be submitted in writing to the CAF member‚Äôs local COL or testing coordinator within ten working days of the day on which the test results were received by the CAF member.

### Reporting and Recording of Test Results

**6.7** The certified SOL test results and profiles of a CAF member must be reported, recorded within the CDA results database and HRMS, and updated throughout the career of the CAF member.

7\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**7.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for the CAF as an institution, and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated.
