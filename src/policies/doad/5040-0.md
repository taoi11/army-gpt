1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2015-06-25

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director History and Heritage (DHH)

2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** The Directorate of Heritage and History was founded in 1996, following the amalgamation of the National Defence History Directorate and the Directorate of Military Traditions and Heritage. The Directorate is mandated to preserve and communicate Canada’s military history and foster pride in Canadian military heritage. See the DHH Web site for links to extensive information on military history and heritage.

### Policy Statement

**2.2** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  implementing measures necessary for the capture and preservation of Canadian military history and heritage; and
2.  researching, maintaining and interpreting the military heritage of Canada for CAF members and the general public.

### Requirements

**2.3** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  maintain the CAF identity system to embody the visible and audible attributes that identify a person or thing as belonging to the CAF, in order to reinforce the chain of command and foster group identity, cohesion and operational effectiveness;

**Note –** Attributes of the CAF identity system include uniforms, insignia, flags, music, appointments, accoutrements, organizational titles and ceremonial (see DAOD 5040-2, _Canadian Armed Forces Identity System_).

2.  collect and preserve historical records and other material related to the mandate of the CAF in order to:
    1.  contribute to the shaping of Canadian identity; and
    2.  foster support for the CAF
3.  facilitate historical research by the DND, the CAF and the general public;
4.  produce official histories of the CAF and the former services; and
5.  identify, if possible, the remains of members of the CAF and former services found at historical crash sites, shipwrecks and battlefields and inter them with appropriate ceremony.

3\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**3.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
