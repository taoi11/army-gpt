1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2015-06-25

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director History and Heritage (DHH)

2\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Context

**2.1** The CAF are the armed forces of Her Majesty raised by Canada and are organized, equipped and trained for tasks that the Government of Canada (GC) may assign, including participation in armed conflict. To identify a person or thing as belonging to the CAF, the CAF identity system embodies visible and audible attributes as set out in paragraph 2.3.

### Purpose

**2.2** The CAF identity system is designed to reinforce the chain of command and foster group identity, cohesion and operational effectiveness.

### Attributes of the CAF Identity System

**2.3** The CAF identity system includes the following attributes:

1.  uniforms, insignias, badges, accoutrements and flags;
2.  marches, calls and other music;
3.  appointments and organizational titles;
4.  military forms of address;
5.  battle honours;
6.  unit lineages and order of precedence;
7.  standardized drill and ceremonial;
8.  alliances, affiliations and partnerships;
9.  days of commemoration; and
10.  the naming of works, buildings and geographical features.

**2.4** Details concerning the CAF identity system are set out in the manuals listed in section 5, _Other References_. Regulations and orders as to dress are set out in QR&O Chapter 17, _Dress and Appearance_.

### Federal Identity Program (FIP)

**2.5** Federal departments and their programs, services, assets and activities are identified in accordance with the corporate identity standards of the FIP of the GC. The FIP governs the use of the official symbols of the GC, including the flag symbol, the Arms of Canada and the “Canada” wordmark. The DND is subject to the FIP in its entirety. The CAF is exempt from the FIP but the CAF integrates the “Canada” wordmark on specific communications materials and assets if operationally practical.

3\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**3.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
