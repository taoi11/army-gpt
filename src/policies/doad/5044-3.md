2\. Definition
--------------

**military deployment** (_déploiement militaire_)

Military deployment means the temporary relocation of military forces or individual CF members on a mission to an area of operations, exclusive of normal training or exercise.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/5000-series/5044/5044-3-deployment-support-groups.html#wb-tphp)

3\. Context
-----------

**General**

**3.1** Military deployments may occur with little or no notice and can impose significant stress on both the CF member and the member's family. A Deployment Support Group (DSG) can help the CF member and family cope with a military deployment, and contribute to the well-being of the family unit.

**3.2** DSG is the common CF title for the traditional Naval Shore Element, Army Rear Party and Air Sponsor Group. Within the respective environments, the traditional titles may continue to be used.

**3.3** Commanding officers (COs) shall ensure that a consistent level of support is provided to deployed CF members and their families, in both official languages, during all phases of a military deployment through the provision of a DSG.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/5000-series/5044/5044-3-deployment-support-groups.html#wb-tphp)

4\. Principles

**4.1** The role of a DSG is to contribute to the well-being of deployed CF members and their families. The DSG shall provide:

1.  access to local military family resources, programs and services;
2.  information on civilian family related programs and services;
3.  accurate and timely mission information; and
4.  assistance during family-related emergencies.

**Establishment**

**4.2** The unit, base, wing, brigade, task group or formation as appropriate to a military deployment and participants (hereinafter referred to as the "coordinating authority") shall establish a local DSG in support of the military deployment.

**Composition**

**4.3** The DSG should be composed of CF members selected from the unit to be deployed or augmented from other units, with a warrant officer/petty officer first class (WO/PO1) or above, or an officer, in charge.

**Cooperation**

**4.4** The DSG should be given the cooperation and participation of all the groups and organizations of the CF Family Network identified in DAOD 5044-1, _Families,_ in order to be fully effective and provide the best possible support to the CF member and family.

**Participants**

**4.5** The coordinating authority and the assigned DSG staff members are primarily responsible for the establishment and operation of the DSG. Their responsibilities vary according to the phase and type of the military deployment.

**Phases**

**4.6** The three phases of a military deployment are:

1.  pre-deployment;
2.  deployment; and
3.  post-deployment.

**Personal Information**

**4.7** All participants in the DSG shall ensure that the personal information of CF members and their families is protected in accordance with the _Privacy Act._

**Mission Augmentees**

**4.8** CF members who deploy as individual augmentees and their families shall receive DSG services from their unit, base or wing who will request the assistance of the Military Family Resource Centre (MFRC) nearest to the augmentee’s family.
