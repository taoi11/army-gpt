2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** The DND and the CAF recognize that ensuring access to an appropriate range of personnel support programs:

1.  enhances the well-being of CAF members, former members and their families; and
2.  contributes to operational effectiveness and readiness.

**2.2** Personnel support programs are funded by public and non-public property resources for the benefit of CAF members, former members and their families. Authority and general guidance for public and non-public property support are set out in:

1.  sections 38 to 41 of the _National Defence Act_;
2.  QR&O article 4.61, _Recreation Programs_;
3.  DAOD 9003-1, _Non-Public Property Governance Framework, Chief of Military Personnel and the Non-Public Property Board_; and
4.  A-PS-110-001/AG-002, _Morale and Welfare Programs in the Canadian Forces_.

### Policy Statement

**2.3** The DND and the CAF are committed to ensuring that CAF members, wherever they serve, former members and their families have access to personnel support programs and facilities.

### Requirements

**2.4** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  manage personnel support programs in accordance with:
    1.  A-PS-110-001/AG-002; and
    2.  the _Personnel Support Programs Policy Manual_;
2.  conduct periodic reviews of personnel support policies to:
    1.  assess continuing relevance; and
    2.  contemplate future requirements; and
3.  validate compliance with functional direction.

**2.5** The Sr VP PSP must notify the CMP of any non-compliance with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**3.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
