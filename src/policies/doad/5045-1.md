----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2022-08-11

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Administrative Response Centre (ARC)

2\. Overview
------------

### Context

**2.1** The CAF is committed to maintaining a high level of operational effectiveness and readiness. To that end, the CAF Sports Program is a critical enabler in achieving a physically and mentally fit fighting force. For the purposes of this DAOD, sport is a set of physical exercises, requiring physical efforts and skills that are played or done according to rules. Sport can be in the form of individual or team participation, generally giving rise to competition and enjoyment. Sport also involves procedures and requires the use of tactics and strategies.

**2.2** While sport requires that an individual or a team of participants compete against an opponent, it also includes preparation for competition. The competitive nature of sport may also require the development and involvement of support personnel such as coaches, officials, athletic trainers and administrators.

**Requirements**

**2.3** This DAOD sets out responsibilities, command and control, and guidelines governing the organization and conduct of the CAF Sports Program. This DAOD does not apply to humanitarian and charitable projects with a sport element.

**2.4** The CAF Sports Program is administered by the Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services / Personnel Support Programs (CFMWS/PSP) on behalf of the CAF, in accordance with the following:

a.     A-PS-110-001/AG-002, _Morale and Welfare Programs in the Canadian Forces,_ Volume 1, Support for Morale and Welfare Programs and Non-Public Property;

b.     DAOD 5045-0, _Canadian Forces Personnel Support Programs_; and

c.      other related policies included in the References section of this DAOD.

### Objectives

**2.5** The objectives of the CAF Sports Program are to:

a.     strengthen mental, social and physical wellness;

b.     develop attributes consistent with military core competencies; and

c.      develop esprit de corps and morale.

**2.6** The objectives of the CAF Sports Program are met by the participation of CAF members in individual and team sports in which instruction, training and competition from novice to elite are available.

3\. CAF Sports Program
----------------------

**Description**

**3.1** The CAF Sports Program provides opportunities to participate, perform and work with the CAF leadership and stakeholders to further the impact of sport, beyond the CAF Sports Program.

**3.2** Sports participation and competitive sports are an integral part of the continuing training and development of CAF members. As a critical operational enabler, the CAF Sports Program is a key contributor to the mental, social and physical wellness of CAF members.

**Structure**

**3.3** The CAF Sports Program provides intramural and extramural sports as described in the following paragraphs.

**Intramural Sports**

**3.4** Intramural sports are the foundation of the CAF Sports Program in which the majority of CAF members participate. Intramural sports are designed and delivered at bases, wings and units for CAF members to:

a.     provide opportunities for participation in sports in a friendly, safe and positive environment on defence establishments or in surrounding communities;

b.     gain fundamental skills and knowledge to prevent injuries; and

c.      develop attitudes that will ensure development and enhance participation in organized and unorganized sports at the local level.

**Extramural Sports**

**3.5** Extramural sports target CAF members who want to achieve their maximum potential, with opportunities to compete in regional, national and international championships, military or civilian. Extramural sports:

a.     consists of sports which may be military or civilian;

b.     primarily take place outside of a defence establishment;

c.      may occur at the local, regional, national or international level, individually or in teams;

d.     may include international championships and sporting activities hosted in Canada by the CAF or outside of Canada by foreign military forces;

e.     permit the demonstration of Canadian and CAF values on the national and international stage;

f.       establish and promote international collaboration; and

g.     support CAF retention, recruitment and transition.

**3.6** Temporary duty (TD) for CAF members participating in extramural sports, when such competition meets the objectives of the CAF Sports Program, is authorized in accordance with the _Canadian Forces Temporary Duty Travel Instructions_ (CFTDTI).

**Other Sporting Activities**

**3.7** Beyond the sports offered under the CAF Sports Program, other sporting activities may be approved in support of the mission of a base, wing or unit if they meet the CAF Sports Program objectives. At all times, the risk and benefit of the proposed activity must be considered. Measures must be implemented to manage the risks to the CAF and CAF members.

**3.8** Certain sporting activities are not authorized as part of the CAF Sports Program due to an unacceptably high risk of injuries. These sporting activities often involve extreme speed or height, a high level of physical exertion or highly specialized equipment. The current sporting activities that are not authorized as part of the CAF Sports Program are:

a.     motorized sporting activities such as rallies, derbies, drifting, demolitions and trials;

b.     motor racing using automobiles, motorcycles, aircraft, snowmobiles or speedboats;

c.      boxing, including any style of kickboxing; and

d.     mixed martial arts with a boxing element, e.g. striking to the head with hand, fist, elbow, foot, shin or knee.

**Participation and Duty Status**

**3.9** Before taking part in the CAF Sports Program, a CAF member must receive approval in writing from their commanding officer (CO).

**3.10** CAF members participating in any sport under the CAF Sports Program must successfully complete the Fitness for Operational Requirements of Canadian Armed Forces Employment (FORCE) Evaluation or the Common Military Tasks Fitness Evaluation, as required under DAOD 5023-2, _Common Military Tasks Fitness Evaluation_, unless prescribed otherwise by a health care provider as part of a recovery program.

**3.11** CAF members are not required to be on duty in order to participate in intramural sports of the CAF Sports Program. Their participation does not impact their duty status.

**3.12** CAF members must be on duty while participating in extramural sports of the CAF Sports Program.

### Suspensions and Disciplinary Measures

**3.13** Any participant in the CAF Sports Program, whether as an athlete, official, coach, athletic trainer or administrator, must respect the principles, values and expected behaviours set out in the _Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_, whether on or off the field of play. CAF members who fail to comply with the principles, values and expected behaviours may be subject to:

a.     administrative action by the CAF member’s chain of command; and

b.     sanctions under the CAF Sports Program, as set out in the CFMWS CAF Sports Policies.

4\. Administration
------------------

### Finance

**4.1** Paragraph 14 of Chapter 5 of Section 3 of A-PS-110-001/AG-002 provides that public support is authorized for the CAF Sports Program as a morale and welfare program.

### Claim of Disability

**4.4** If an application for a disability pension or other benefit is made to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) by or on behalf of a CAF member reporting an injury or death arising from activities conducted under the CAF Sports Program:

a.     VAC adjudicators review all available information to determine if a person is suffering from a disability resulting from a service-related injury or disease, or a non-service-related injury or disease that was aggravated by service; and

b.     the determination of entitlement to a pension or other benefit under the Veterans Well-being Act is made by VAC or the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, not by the Department of National Defence (DND), the CAF or CFMWS.

**4.5** DND employees may support CAF members participating in the CAF Sports Program in accordance with directives of the Assistant Deputy Minister (Human Resources _–_ Civilian) and applicable collective agreements.
