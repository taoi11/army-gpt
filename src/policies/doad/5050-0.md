4\. Policy Direction
--------------------

Context
-------

**4.1** The DND and the CAF are responsible for the management of CF personnel records within an all-inclusive framework compatible with procedures and processes established by the ADM(IM) for the management of other corporate records.

**4.2** CF personnel records remain the property of the Crown. After transfer to LAC, they are subsequently reviewed 90 years after the date of birth of the CAF member for military or historical value and determination of final disposition.

### Policy Statement

**4.3** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  creating and maintaining CF personnel records for all CAF members in accordance with applicable TB and LAC policies and procedures;
2.  managing CF personnel records in accordance with applicable legislation and TB policies and procedures that:
    1.  maintain the integrity of CF personnel records; and
    2.  allow CAF members to review their personnel records; and
3.  disposing of CF personnel records in conformity with RDAs.

### Requirements

**4.4** Consistent with TB and LAC policies, the DND and the CAF shall ensure that:

1.  CF personnel records are maintained from enrolment to a specific period of time after release, and then transferred to LAC in accordance with the established RDAs;
2.  only appropriate access to CF personnel records is permitted;
3.  CAF members have access to their own personnel records in accordance with the _Privacy Act_; and
4.  regular audit of CF personnel records is conducted to confirm that the management and administration of human resources are effectively supported by useful, complete and accurate information as required by the TBS, and that audit findings are provided on request to the TBS for review.

### Records Management Framework

**4.5** The DND and the CAF manage two types of records:

1.  CF personnel records; and
