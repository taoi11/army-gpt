3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** CAF personnel casualty administration records (CAFCARs) must be accurately created, maintained, stored, secured and managed, and available for access, in accordance with the _Privacy Act_.

**3.2** Policies and procedures on the origin and standards of CAFCARs are described in the DAODs set out as references to this DAOD.

### Director Casualty Support Management

**3.3** As the CAF personnel record custodian of CAFCARs, DCSM must:

1.  maintain and process CAFCARs; and
2.  provide direction and guidance on the management of all information placed on CAFCARs.

**3.4** DCSM maintains the following CAF personnel record components as CAFCARs:

1.  the military casualty database; and
2.  completed Form CF 98, _Report of Injury, Disease or Illness_, records.

### Audit

**3.5** DCSM must conduct an audit of CAFCARs at least every five years to confirm that:

1.  the management and administration of these records are conducted in compliance with government legislation and professional standards; and
2.  the records contain useful, complete and accurate information.

### Ownership

**3.6** CAFCARs are created and collected in the conduct of CAF activities and therefore belong to Her Majesty in right of Canada and not to any individual or organization.

4\. Records Management Life Cycle
---------------------------------

### Military Casualty Database Life Cycle

**4.1** The military casualty database is a records management system that DCSM utilizes to capture and track all information DCSM receives concerning military casualties. The CAF personnel record components collected in the military casualty database are used to:

1.  coordinate the DND and the CAF response to a CAF member or surviving family members; and
2.  analyze the information for the purpose of problem identification.

**4.2** When contacted concerning a military casualty, DCSM must create an entry record in the military casualty database according to the service number and name of the CAF member. DCSM must update the database to reflect action taken in response to the entry record.

**4.3** CAF personnel record components created in the military casualty database must be retained permanently until archiving becomes necessary.

### Form CF 98

**4.4** Form CF 98 is completed on a CAF member for an injury, illness or disease. Page 2 of Form CF 98 sets out detailed instructions for its completion.

**4.5** Upon the receipt of a properly completed Form CF 98, DCSM must log it into the military casualty database according to the service number and name of the CAF member.

**4.6** Once logged in, DCSM must distribute Form CF 98 as follows:

1.  for Regular Force members, DCSM must forward it to National Defence Headquarters/Director Human Resources Information Management (Personnel Electronic Records Management Information System) (PERMIS), where it is scanned into the permanent PERMIS file of the CAF member; and
2.  for Reserve Force members, DCSM must retain it until archiving becomes necessary.

### CAF Personnel Record Components in PERMIS

**4.7** CAF personnel record components contained in the PERMIS are held for a period of ten years from the date of release of a Regular Force member and are then transferred to Library and Archives Canada (LAC).

5\. Disclosure of Personal Information to an Individual
-------------------------------------------------------

### Sources of Federal Employee Information

**5.1** The Treasury Board _Information about programs and information holdings_ Web site assists current and former CAF members to:

1.  locate their personal information held by the Government; and
2.  exercise their rights under the _Privacy Act_.

### Personal Information Banks

**5.2** Personal information banks (PIBs) are established through consultation with LAC to ensure the correct disposition of a record. The _Privacy Act_ requires that PIBs must include all personal information that is organized and retrievable by:

1.  the name of an individual; or
2.  an identifying number, symbol or other particular detail assigned to an individual.

**5.3** PIBs are identified with a three-letter code and number for a specific set, are accompanied by their retention and disposal standards, and are listed in the _Info Source – Sources of Federal Government and Employee Information_ Web site. They are reviewed annually to ensure that information created on CAF members is recorded and managed in accordance with existing policies.

**5.4** The CAF have recorded personal information in the following three types of PIBs:

1.  PPU (particular bank – public);
2.  PPE (particular bank – employee); and
3.  PSE (standard bank).

### CAFCAR Personal Information Banks

**5.5** CAFCARs are described in _Info Source – Sources of Federal Government and Employee Information_ under the following PIBs:

1.  PPE 817 – Canadian Forces Casualty Database;
2.  PPE 818 – Canadian Forces Member Personnel Information File (for Form CF 98 of a Regular Force member); and
3.  PPE 836 – Unit Military Personnel Bank (Form CF 478, _Personnel Records Envelope_, for Form CF 98 of a Reserve Force member).

### Requests for CAFCAR Information

**5.6** For information concerning formal or informal requests for personal information in CAFCARs, see DAOD 1002-0, _Administration of the Privacy Act_, and the other DAODs in the 1002 series.

6\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

### Compliance

**6.1** CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, CAF members may seek direction through their chain of command. Military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their CAF members with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**6.2** CAF members are accountable to their military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of a level one advisor or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**6.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both; and
