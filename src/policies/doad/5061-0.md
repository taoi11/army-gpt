The human subject's consent must be sought for secondary uses of the data concerning the human subject.

**protocol** (_protocole_)

**research project** (_projet de recherche_)

A research project is any study designed to contribute to general knowledge

**risk** (_risque_)

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** Research involving human subjects includes:

1.  the evaluation of vehicles or equipment to determine their effect on human subjects;
2.  the study of behaviour;
3.  the testing of processes, drugs, vaccines, biological, investigational medical devices or devices involving human subjects, or biological tissue products originating from human subjects;
4.  the development of new standard operating procedures or specialized procedures involving potential risk in excess of that usually inherent in the individual's daily life, occupation or field of service; and/or
5.  the solicitation, acquisition or use of confidential information or opinions.

**3.2** Research involving human subjects does **not** include:

1.  the evaluation of vehicles or equipment without consideration of their effect on human subjects;
2.  the study of training or field operations in which new features introduced will not increase risk, or stress, to personnel beyond the level already present in their daily life, occupation or field of service; and
3.  the collection or use of existing data or medical specimens where these sources are available to the public or where the information is recorded in such a way that the human subjects cannot be identified.

### Policy Statement

**3.3** The DND and the CAF shall sponsor, support or conduct research projects involving human subjects only where:

1.  the research provides scientifically valid advancements in knowledge that justify the risks involved;
2.  the research substantially benefits the DND or the CAF in the pursuit of operational tasks and missions or departmental priorities; and
3.  participation is voluntary and is based on the full, informed consent of the human subjects.

### Requirements

**3.4** Every research project sponsored, supported or conducted by the DND and the CAF is dependant upon the approval of a human research ethics committee. The committee shall review and, if appropriate, approve:

1.  the protocol of all research projects involving human subjects, and
2.  the use of DND employees or CAF members as human subjects;

**3.5** The review must take place before the start of the research project.

**3.6** All DND research contracts must reflect the direction outlined in the DAOD 5061 series.

**3.7** Directors General responsible for the conduct of research and the Medical Services Research Board shall establish human research ethics committees to review research projects undertaken in their areas of responsibility.
