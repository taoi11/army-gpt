1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2014-03-04

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Personnel Generation Requirements (DPGR)

2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** CAF strategic objectives, capability requirements, plans and programmes provide the foundation for identifying CAF work requirements and the wide variety of duties that CAF members must perform.

**2.2** The military employment structure (MES):

1.  identifies and classifies CAF work requirements into a number of key elements, including military occupations and sub-occupations; and
2.  provides the framework and specifications for personnel management activities across the components of the CAF.

### Policy Statement

**2.3** The CAF is committed to the establishment and maintenance of a flexible and responsive MES that enhances the capability of the CAF by enabling the development and employment of skilled and qualified CAF members to support the mission to defend Canada and Canadian interests.

### Requirements

**2.4** The CAF must:

1.  establish policies, procedures and processes for the MES;
2.  develop, maintain and implement the MES in order to meet current and future CAF work requirements;
3.  establish the MES using principles that:
    1.  recognize the primacy of operational effectiveness;
    2.  optimize the scope of required work;
    3.  optimize the training and development of CAF members; and
    4.  rationalize the progression of work for employment at higher levels with a broader scope of responsibility;
4.  manage the MES in accordance with A-PD-055-001/AG-001, _Canadian Forces Military Employment Structure_, Volume 1, _General_; and
5.  conduct periodic reviews of the MES to:
    1.  assess continuing relevance;
    2.  determine new requirements; and
    3.  validate compliance with functional direction.

**2.5** To establish the MES, occupation authorities must provide input and advice to CMP on the definition and development of CAF work requirements and employment structures for their assigned military occupations.

**2.6** The DPGR must notify the CMP of any non-compliance with this DAOD.

3\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**3.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for the CAF as an institution and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated.
