1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2015-02-10

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members (NCMs) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:**

*   CF Military Personnel Instruction 02/07, _Authority and Management Framework – Military Employment Structure (MES)_
*   CF Military Personnel Instruction 03/07, _Use of the Sub-Occupation Construct within the Military Employment Structure (MES)_
*   CANFORGEN 211/11, _New Job Based System and Qualification Framework_

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Military Personnel (CMP)

**Enquiries:** Director Personnel Generation Requirements (DPGR)

2\. Overview
------------

### Context

**2.1** CAF members are required to perform a wide variety of duties. Some duties are common and performed by all CAF members, whereas other duties related to a military occupation are performed only by the CAF members assigned to that military occupation. All such duties represent CAF work requirements and must be specified, controlled and changed in response to Government of Canada defence policy and objectives, CAF strategic capability requirements and operational imperatives.

**2.2** The military employment structure (MES):

1.  identifies and classifies CAF work requirements into a number of key elements, including military occupations and sub-occupations; and
2.  provides the framework and specifications for personnel management activities across the components of the CAF.

**2.3** The MES framework is centrally controlled by the CMP. It is supported by a network of DND employees and CAF members who provide advice and information for the analysis of CAF work requirements. It is dependent on the allocation of military establishment positions controlled by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS).

**Note –** Details on organization and establishment policy are set out in A-AE-219-001/AG-001, _Organization_, Volume 1, _Concept and Policy_.

**2.4** A centralized MES framework provides for:

1.  lower costs;
2.  objectivity and transparency in the performance of CAF work analysis;
3.  coherence and alignment of CAF work with strategic capabilities; and
4.  defensible military employment specifications.

### Purposes

**2.5** The MES framework:

1.  provides the elements that define, structure and classify CAF work requirements to meet current and evolving strategic capability requirements, in accordance with the principles set out in DAOD 5070-0, _Military Employment Structure_;
2.  provides information to enable CAF personnel management activities (i.e. personnel requirement definition, personnel production planning, recruiting and selection, professional development, assignment, performance management and appraisal, and compensation and benefits);
3.  enhances the organizational and operational effectiveness of the CAF; and
4.  enables the allocation of military establishment positions to military occupations.

### MES Principles

**2.6** The MES must be established in accordance with the principles set out in DAOD 5070-0. The following table sets out amplification of these principles to be used when analyzing CAF work and developing structures for military occupations within the MES framework:

| MES Principle | Amplification |
| --- | --- |
| Operational effectiveness | 
*   Recognize the primacy of deployed operational requirements.

 |
| Work scope optimization | 

*   Ensure the scope of CAF work is neither too broad nor too narrow.
*   Facilitate employment flexibility.
*   Group the work requirements in a rational way to optimize the development of CAF members with related skill sets.

 |
| Training optimization | 

*   Support the effective, efficient and timely delivery of individual training and education.

 |
| Career path rationalization | 

*   Establish a progression of work that is to be performed to form the foundation for the management of CAF members who demonstrate potential for employment at higher ranks or with a broader scope of responsibility at the same rank.

 |

3\. Framework Elements and Management
-------------------------------------

### Elements

**3.1** The following table outlines the three elements of the MES framework and their purposes:

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Military occupation | Set out the work requirements that have been structured and grouped by similar duties, tasks and competencies.
**Note –** A military occupation may include one or more sub-occupations that set out complementary work requirements related to the military occupation.

 |
| Military employment specification | Set out the professional development, performance and work requirements for CAF members.

**Note –** Military employment specifications consist of:

*   the officer general specification and the NCM general specification;
*   military occupation specifications; and
*   specialty specifications.

 |
| Military employment qualification | Define particular competencies and recognizes the attainment of knowledge, skills and abilities that enable CAF members to perform their duties.

**Note –** A military employment qualification may include a qualification for:

*   rank attainment;
*   experience attainment;
*   academic attainment;
*   specialized work unique to a military occupation; and
*   specialized work common to more than one military occupation.

 |

### Management

**3.2** In accordance with DAOD 5070-0, the CMP has designated occupational authorities (OAs) for the management of specific military occupations as set out in the following table:

| The … | has been designated as the OA for military occupations assigned to the … |
| --- | --- |
| Commander, Royal Canadian Navy | Royal Canadian Navy for the purpose of providing combat capable general purpose maritime forces. |
| Commander, Canadian Army | Canadian Army for the purpose of providing combat capable land forces. |
| Commander, Royal Canadian Air Force | Royal Canadian Air Force for the purpose of providing air forces for the conduct of air, surface and sub-surface operations. |
| Assistant CMP | Military Personnel Command for the purpose of providing support services to other commands. |

4\. Framework Change Management Process
---------------------------------------

### Process

**4.1** The MES change management process guides the activities required to create, amend or delete a structure for a military occupation.

### Process Requirements

**4.2** The MES change management process must:

1.  provide a structured methodology for analyzing work requirements and developing, implementing and validating appropriate structure options for military occupations;
2.  enable transparency and objectivity in analysis and decision making;
3.  produce defensible employment specifications; and
4.  satisfy the MES principles.

**4.3** The MES change management process is set out in detail in A-PD-055-001/AG-001, _Canadian Forces Military Employment Structure_, Volume 1, _General_.

5\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**5.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for the CAF as an institution and for CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.
