3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** ADM(IM), as the Defence Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the DND and the CAF, is responsible for the effective and efficient management of IM and information technology (IT) as described in the Treasury Board _Directive on Information Management Roles and Responsibilities and the Directive on Management of Information Technology_.

**3.2** This DAOD, along with the DND and CAF IM and IT Policy Framework, provides the strategic context on how the Defence CIO provides supporting direction and guidance relating to the management of IM, IT, information security, IT security, communication security (COMSEC) and defence terminology to the DND and the CAF.

### Policy Statement

**3.3** The DND and the CAF are committed to a collaborative approach for the delivery of IM and IT, aligned with DND and CAF priorities, and supported by centralized oversight and direction.

### Requirements

**3.4** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  develop and maintain integrated IM and IT business plans;
2.  establish DND- and CAF-wide strategic direction and governance structures for IM and IT;
3.  ensure that the Defence CIO has visibility on all IM and IT activities across the DND and the CAF; and
4.  provide clear, concise and consistent direction and guidance on the management of IM, IT, IT security, information security, COMSEC and defence terminology.

4\. Consequences

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented.
