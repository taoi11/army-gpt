**information asset** (_ressource d’information_)

A body of information defined and managed as a single unit so the body of information can be understood, shared, protected and exploited effectively.  
  
**Note –** An information asset has recognizable and manageable value, risk and content for DND business and CAF operations. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 696375)

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** Information is a strategic asset and its management is integrated into all aspects of DND business and CAF operations for the delivery and support, on a timely basis, of trusted and secure information, in line with Canadian defence policy.

**3.2** ADM(IM), in the role of Defence CIO, is accountable to the Deputy Minister (DM) and to the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) for the strategic management and protection of information, open government and recordkeeping. This forms the basis of sound evidence-based decision making that enables DND to meet its business objectives and the CAF to succeed in operations, while meeting the obligations of the Government of Canada (GC).

**3.3** For purposes of the DAOD 6001 series, information management (IM) includes, but is not limited to, the management of:

1.  information assets;
2.  open government services;
3.  archival services;
4.  library material;
5.  forms; and
6.  information architecture services.

**3.4** Assistant Deputy Minister (Data, Innovation and Analytics) (ADM(DIA)), as the Chief Data Officer, oversees the management of DND and CAF data. Given that information includes data, ADM(IM)/CIO policy and instructions with respect to IM are therefore complementary to, and should be read in conjunction with, ADM(DIA) policy and instructions with respect to data management and analytics.

**3.5** The DAOD 6001 series should be read in conjunction with the _DND and CAF IM and IT Policy Framework_, and any other relevant policies, directives, instructions, standards and guidelines, including the Treasury Board:

1.  _Policy on Service and Digital;_
2.  _Directive on Service and Digital;_
3.  _Standard on Email Management;_ and
4.  _Guideline for Employees of the Government of Canada: Information Management (IM) Basics._

### Policy Statement

**3.6** The DND and the CAF are committed to the open and strategic management of information that:

1.  is transparent, applied consistently throughout its life cycle and supports the outcomes of programmes, services, operational requirements and accountabilities;
2.  establishes governance structures to ensure the integration and management of information within information technology (IT) and other processes;
3.  enables the delivery of timely, trusted and secure information to the right people;
4.  enables informed and evidence-based decision making; and
5.  documents business and operations for accountability, transparency and collaboration.

### Requirements

**3.7** The DND and the CAF must ensure that:

1.  DND employees, CAF members, contractors and other persons employed by or authorized to work with the DND and the CAF receive IM briefings and training;
2.  sufficient IM functional specialists, including full-time information management officers (IMOs) in level one advisor (L1), commander of command and commander of formation organizations, are available and trained to aid with the implementation of IM practices;
3.  the role of IMO is assigned to DND employees and CAF members;
4.  the IM governance model is supported by representatives at the appropriate level to foster and achieve a culture of sound IM practices;
5.  programmes, services, business and operations integrate IM requirements into their design, development, implementation, evaluation and reporting activities;
6.  IM services are client-centric by design and consider IM innovation and experimentation during the process;
7.  information is managed through its life cycle while remaining relevant, authentic, quality-controlled and cost-effective to meet operational needs and accountabilities;
8.  decisions and decision-making processes:
    1.  are documented and recorded to support the continuity of business and operations;
    2.  document the evolution of policies and programmes; and
    3.  allow for independent evaluation, audit and review;
9.  information is shared in the DND and the CAF and with other government departments (OGD) and agencies and released to the GC Open Government portal to the greatest extent possible, while respecting security, privacy and legal requirements;
10.  electronic systems are the preferred means of IM; and
11.  IM is enabled by a digital transformation approach.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
