3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** DAOD 1000-6, _Policy Framework for Information and Information Technology Management_, assigns functional authority for information technology (IT) management to ADM(IM)/CIO. In support of the Vice Chief of Defence Staff _Project Approval Directive_, the ADM(IM)/CIO acts, in accordance with the Treasury Board (TB) _Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments_ and the _Directive on the Management of Projects and Programmes_, as the senior designated official (SDO) for the planning and management of DND and CAF IT projects and programmes.

**Note** _–_ For additional information on the management of IT projects, see DAOD 6002-10, _Management of Information Technology Projects_.

**3.2** The ADM(IM)/CIO also acts as the Defence Official for Cyber Security (DOCS) for the DND and the CAF in accordance with TB _Policy on Service and Digital_.

**3.3** In accordance with the TB _Directive on Service and Digital_, ADM(IM) in the role of CIO is responsible for approving the IT component of DND and CAF strategies, plans, initiatives, projects, procurements and spending authority requests.

**3.4** IT is a strategic asset that enables DND business continuity and the success of CAF operations.

**3.5** The effective management of IT requires that the information system design authority (ISDA), the chief technology security architect (CTSA), and operational, technical and security authorities clearly understand their roles and scope of authority when participating in the decision-making process.

**3.6** The boundaries between IT, operational technology (OT) and platform technology (PT) can be difficult to define due to continuous advancements in technologies and many defence capabilities being enabled by technologies that span the boundaries between IT, OT and PT.

**3.7** For the purposes of the DAOD 6002 series, IT supports OT and PT to ensure their integration and interoperability with technology infrastructure and applications, and includes any DND and CAF technology other than:

1.  OT that is installed as additional equipment on a platform; and
2.  PT that is built-in to a platform as a component of the platform.

**3.8** This DAOD should be read in conjunction with the _DND and CAF IM and IT Policy Framework_, DAOD 6002 series and other relevant policies, directives, instructions, standards and guidelines.

### Policy Statement

**3.9** The DND and the CAF are committed to:

1.  setting direction, establishing clear authorities and using a collaborative approach for the integrated planning, management, delivery and support of IT; and
2.  supporting a digitally enabled CAF that is strategically relevant, operationally responsive and tactically decisive.

### Requirements

**3.10** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  ensure that IT is managed as a strategic asset and in accordance with Government of Canada (GC) strategies and priorities, and the mandate of the DND and the CAF;
2.  use consistent definitions of IT roles, functions and services;
3.  issue direction and communicate clear expectations with respect to IT;
4.  keep pace with technological changes;
5.  ensure interoperability with allies;
6.  address by design the applicable requirements for accessibility, diversity and inclusion, official languages, protection of information and the environment when procuring or developing IT;
7.  provide clear, concise and timely direction for the integrated planning, management, delivery and support of IT;
8.  establish direction that builds on and is in alignment with GC direction on IT; and
9.  ensure that DND business and CAF operations are digitally enabled.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
