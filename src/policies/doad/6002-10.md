1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2013-11-28

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Assistant Deputy Minister (Information Management) (ADM(IM)) / Chief Information Officer (CIO)

**Enquiries:** Director Defence Information Management Planning (DDIMP)

2\. Definitions
---------------

**management of projects** (_gestion des projets_)

Encompasses the structure (framework) within which projects are initiated, planned, executed, controlled and closed. (_Policy on the Management of Projects_, Treasury Board)

**project gate** (_points de contrôle des projets_)

Is a key decision and control point that occurs before the next major milestone or deliverable (e.g. business case) or a new project phase (e.g. implementation) begins. (_A Guide to Project Gating for IT-Enabled Projects_, Treasury Board)

**project management** (_gestion de projet_)

Is the systematic planning, organizing and control of allocated resources to accomplish identified project objectives and outcomes. Project management is normally reserved for focused, non-repetitive, time-limited activities with some degree of risk, and for activities beyond the usual scope of program (operational) activities. (_Policy on the Management of Projects_, Treasury Board)

3\. Overview
------------

**3.1** Under the Treasury Board _Policy on the Management of Projects_, a project is any activity or series of activities that:

1.  has a beginning and an end;
2.  is required to produce defined outputs and realize specific outcomes in support of a public policy objective, within a clear schedule and resource plan; and
3.  is undertaken within specific time, cost and performance parameters.

**3.2** The _Policy on the Management of Projects_ also provides that governance and oversight mechanisms must be in place for all projects, ensuring proper management throughout the project life cycle and that opportunities for project integration are considered by a deputy head both across their department and the Government of Canada (GC).

**3.3** In alignment with the _Policy on the Management of Projects_, and in support of the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS) _Project Approval Directive_, the ADM(IM) issues direction to ensure that governance and oversight mechanisms are in place for all information technology (IT) and IT-enabled projects undertaken by the DND and the CAF.

**3.4** This DAOD is part of the _DND and CF IM and IT Policy Framework_ and should be read in conjunction with other relevant ADM(IM) policies, instructions, directives, standards and guidance.

**Note –** For the purposes of this DAOD, the term "IT project" includes both IT and IT-enabled projects, other than projects related to weaponry and vehicles with integrated IT functionality.

### Objectives

**3.5** The objectives of this DAOD are to:

1.  establish the gating process for all IT projects; and
2.  identify responsibilities for:
    1.  defining IT project oversight processes and procedures;
    2.  developing IT project gate requirements; and
    3.  providing IT project management advice to the DND and the CAF.

### Expected Results

**3.6** The expected results of this DAOD are:

1.  increased visibility of IT projects and their allocated resources;
2.  improved consistency in the management of IT projects, regardless of funding source; and
3.  consistent monitoring of IT projects throughout their life cycle, ensuring sound stewardship of project funds and providing assurance that project outcomes will be achieved within time and cost constraints.

4\. Project Gating
------------------

### Introduction

**4.1** As directed in Annex B of the _Project Approval Directive_, IT project gating within the DND and the CAF must align with the gating framework found in the Treasury Board _A Guide to Project Gating for IT-Enabled Projects_.

### Project Gating Framework

**4.2** A project gate represents a logical point at which executive decision-makers can determine whether and how to proceed. Project gates effectively open or close the path leading to a subsequent project phase. Gates also provide an opportunity to assess the quality of work to date, and to alter the course of the project and take remedial actions as necessary.

**4.3** The full gating framework defines the following seven gates that might logically be present in every project:

| Gate | Title | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1
 | Strategic assessment and concept

 | 

*   To confirm the project's objectives, both what is to be done and why; and
*   to identify key stakeholders.

 |
| 2

 | Project approach

 | 

*   To confirm that the approach selected to address the business problem or opportunity is both feasible and appropriate.

 |
| 3

 | Business case and general readiness

 | 

*   To confirm that the business case is sufficiently compelling to justify, sustain and guide the project;
*   to identify any shortcomings in readiness for action before approval; and
*   to confirm that key identified risks can be managed.

 |
| 4

 | Project charter and project management plan

 | 

*   To ensure that the resources, support and governance necessary for successful execution are in place prior to construction and implementation.

 |
| 5

 | Detailed project plan and functional specifications

 | 

*   To confirm the completeness and feasibility of the detailed project plan; and
*   to confirm the definition of requirements.

 |
| 6

 | Construction complete and deployment readiness

 | 

*   To confirm the project is fully prepared for successful deployment.

 |
| 7

 | Post-implementation review

 | 

*   To confirm completion, assess the extent to which the project has achieved its goals, and provide an assessment of value for money.

 |

### Project Gating Models

**4.4** While all projects must provide a business case and complete a post-implementation review, not all projects require the implementation of the full gating framework. The following gating models are available, depending on the size, complexity and risk of each project:

| Gate Model | Type | Gates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1
 | Full gating for very large and highly complex projects

 | 

1.  Concept
2.  Approach
3.  Business Case
4.  Project Charter
5.  Detailed Plan
6.  Construction and Deployment
7.  Post-Implementation

 |
| 2

 | Streamlined gating for projects of medium size, complexity and risk

 | 

1.  Approach
2.  Business Case
3.  Pre-Construction
4.  Pre-Deployment
5.  Post-Implementation

 |
| 3

 | Light gating for small, low-risk projects with little complexity

 | 

1.  Business Case
2.  Pre-Construction
3.  Post-Implementation

 |

5\. Requirements
----------------

### IT Projects and the IT Service Delivery Life Cycle

**5.1** Project delivery is the initial phase of how a capability is incorporated into IT service delivery. Once the capability is in service, the operation and support of the individual components and the system as a whole are governed by IT service support and IT asset management.

### _Project Approval Directive_

**5.2** DND employees and CAF members must ensure that any IT project is managed in accordance with the _Project Approval Directive_.

6\. Consequences
----------------

### **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**6.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.

**6.2** Failure by a DND or CAF organization to comply with this DAOD may result in limitations or removal of the organization's authorization to manage IT projects.

7\. Responsibilities
