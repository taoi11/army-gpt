**4.1** “Official use” is any use of an IT system that is necessary to carry out duties and official functions in furtherance of DND and CAF goals and objectives, including:

1.  communicating with other authorized users, other government departments, allies and the private sector; and
2.  conducting research for DND and CAF purposes.

**4.2** This DAOD does not restrict or modify the mandate or legitimate activities of any organization that uses IT systems as a means to conduct DND and CAF business and operations.

**Authorized Use**

**4.3** “Authorized use” is any use of an IT system that, while not necessary to carry out duties and official functions in furtherance of DND and CAF goals and objectives, is permitted, including:

1.  engaging in professional development activities in accordance with DAOD 5031-0, _Learning and Professional Development_;

6.  conducting any union business specifically pre-authorized in writing by a manager or supervisor (see DAOD 5008-1, _Use of Departmental Premises and Equipment, and Electronic Networks, for Bargaining Agent or Union Business_); and
7.  any other use that is consistent with the Treasury Board _Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use_ and this DAOD, and is specifically authorized in writing by a DND manager or supervisor, or a commander, commanding officer (CO) or military supervisor.

**4.4** Authorized use of an IT system is subject to the following limitations:

1.  the duration and frequency must be reasonable;
2.  the performance of the IT system must not be negatively impacted;
3.  there must not be any interference with the performance of the duties and official functions of the authorized user or any other authorized user; and

**4.5** The ADM(IM), a DND manager or supervisor, or a commander, CO or military supervisor, may restrict or prohibit any otherwise-authorized use if:

1.  the use threatens the capability or integrity of an IT system; or
2.  the restriction or prohibition is necessary for operational or administrative reasons.

**4.6** “Unauthorized use” is any use of an IT system that is not an official, authorized or prohibited use, including:

1.  authorized use that is not of a reasonable duration or frequency;
2.  authorized use that interferes with the performance of the duties and official functions of an authorized user;
3.  authorized use that is restricted under paragraph 4.5;

3.  is an intentional act that jeopardizes or could reasonably jeopardize the integrity of an IT system;
4.  accesses or distributes any material whose main focus is pornography, nudity or sexual acts; or

5\. Consequences
----------------

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**5.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for authorized users as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of individual observations in performance evaluations;
3.  revocation of access to IT systems, either in whole or in part;

5.  civil liability;
6.  administrative or disciplinary action, or both, including termination of employment of a DND employee or release of a CAF member; and
7.  contract termination.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.

**5.2** The following table identifies the potential consequences of any unauthorized or prohibited use of an IT system by the type of authorized user:

| For ... | unauthorized or prohibited use of an IT system may result in one or more of the following, depending on the circumstances: |

 |

**Guidance**

**5.3** In the case of any unauthorized use, a DND manager or supervisor, or commander or CO, should consider, as a minimum, the following circumstances before taking any action set out in paragraph 5.1:

1.  the nature of the unauthorized use;
2.  the frequency of similar activity within their DND organization or CAF unit or other element;
3.  the impact of the unauthorized use on the morale and discipline of their DND organization or CAF unit or other element; and
4.  any impact the unauthorized use had or may have had on the operational capabilities of their DND organization or CAF unit or other element.

**Additional Guidance Relating to CAF members**

**5.4** In the case of any unauthorized use by a CAF member, unit authorities should normally take administrative action, but disciplinary proceedings may be taken if the circumstances so warrant.
