**Authorized Use**

**4.3** ‚ÄúAuthorized use‚Äù is any use of an IT system that, while not necessary to carry out duties and official functions in furtherance of DND and CAF goals and objectives, is permitted, including:

1.  engaging in professional development activities in accordance with DAOD 5031-0, _Learning and Professional Development_;

7.  any other use that is consistent with the Treasury Board _Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use_ and this DAOD, and is specifically authorized in writing by a DND manager or supervisor, or a commander, commanding officer (CO) or military supervisor.

**4.4** Authorized use of an IT system is subject to the following limitations:

1.  the duration and frequency must be reasonable;
2.  the performance of the IT system must not be negatively impacted;

3.  is an intentional act that jeopardizes or could reasonably jeopardize the integrity of an IT system;
4.  accesses or distributes any material whose main focus is pornography, nudity or sexual acts; or

5\. Consequences
----------------

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**5.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for authorized users as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

5.  civil liability;
6.  administrative or disciplinary action, or both, including termination of employment of a DND employee or release of a CAF member; and
7.  contract termination.

**Note ‚Äì** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.

**5.2** The following table identifies the potential consequences of any unauthorized or prohibited use of an IT system by the type of authorized user:

| For ... | unauthorized or prohibited use of an IT system may result in one or more of the following, depending on the circumstances: |
| --- | --- |

 |

**Guidance**

**5.3** In the case of any unauthorized use, a DND manager or supervisor, or commander or CO, should consider, as a minimum, the following circumstances before taking any action set out in paragraph 5.1:

1.  the nature of the unauthorized use;
2.  the frequency of similar activity within their DND organization or CAF unit or other element;
3.  the impact of the unauthorized use on the morale and discipline of their DND organization or CAF unit or other element; and
4.  any impact the unauthorized use had or may have had on the operational capabilities of their DND organization or CAF unit or other element.

**Additional Guidance Relating to CAF members**

**5.4** In the case of any unauthorized use by a CAF member, unit authorities should normally take administrative action, but disciplinary proceedings may be taken if the circumstances so warrant.
