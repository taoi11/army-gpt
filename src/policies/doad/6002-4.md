2\. Definitions
---------------

**radio frequency spectrum** (_spectre des radiofréquences_)

The range of useable radio frequencies, between 3 kilohertz and 400 gigahertz, typically used for radio, cellular telephone, satellite, radars and other forms of civilian and military tactical communications and weapon systems. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 43209)

**radio frequency spectrum management** (_gestion du spectre des radiofréquences_)

The planning, coordination and management of the use of the radio frequency spectrum through operational, engineering and administrative procedures, with the objective of enabling electronic systems to perform their functions within intended environments without causing or suffering unacceptable interference. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 37301)

**technical authority** (_autorité technique_)

Authority assigned to a person to set specifications and standards, manage configurations, provide advice and monitor compliance within their area of responsibility. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 43437)

3\. Overview
------------

### **Context**

**3.1** The radio frequency (RF) spectrum is an extremely valuable strategic resource and an essential capability enabler for military communication, sensor, navigation and weapon systems.

**3.2** The DND and CAF concept of operations for RF spectrum management provides for the:

1.  central management of the allocation and use of the RF spectrum;
2.  coordination of all requirements for access to the RF spectrum through National Defence Headquarters for national and international approval; and
3.  operation of all DND and CAF RF spectrum-dependent equipment and systems in accordance with national and international laws, and DND and CAF policies, directives, instructions and standards.

**3.3** The _Radio Regulations_ are an international treaty which covers both legal and technical issues dealing with the international management of the RF spectrum. The _Radiocommunication Act_ and _Radiocommunication Regulations_ regulate the use of the RF spectrum in Canada. To operate legally, all DND and CAF RF spectrum-dependent equipment and systems must be licensed or authorized for use.

**3.4** The department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) is the Canadian national authority for RF spectrum management and delegates certain management authorities and responsibilities to the DND and the CAF.

**3.5** This DAOD should be read in conjunction with the _DND and CAF IM and IT Policy Framework_ and other relevant policies, directives, instructions, standards and guidance, including FSM instructions issued on behalf of ADM(IM) in respect of the use of RF spectrum-dependent equipment and systems. See the ADM(IM) intranet sites in the References section for the relevant policies, directives, instructions, standards and guidance.

### **Objective**

**3.6** The objective of this DAOD is to establish the responsibilities necessary for the management, allocation and support of the RF spectrum used by and of interest to the DND and the CAF.

### **Expected Result**

**3.7** The expected result of this DAOD is the reduction of the number of internal and external RF spectrum interference incidents.

4\. Specifications and Standards
--------------------------------

### **General**

**4.1** B-GT-D35-001/AG-000, _Management of the Radio Frequency Spectrum_ (DNDP 35):

1.  establishes the procedures to obtain RF spectrum access and clearance in and outside Canada; and
2.  ensures RF spectrum supportability for planned and new equipment, acquisition of a licence or authorization for an operation.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/6000-series/6002/6002-4-radio-frequency-spectrum-management.html#wb-tphp)

5. Compliance and Consequences
------------------------------

### **Compliance**

**5.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with the _Radiocommunication Act_, _Radiocommunication Regulations_, _Radio Regulations_, radio licences, this DAOD and FSM instructions. Should clarification of these laws, policies or instructions be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with the _Radiocommunication Act_, _Radiocommunication Regulations_, _Radio Regulations_, radio licences, this DAOD and FSM instructions.

### **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**5.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the _Radiocommunication Act_, _Radiocommunication Regulations_, _Radio Regulations_, radio licences, this DAOD or FSM instructions. Non-compliance may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military supervisors must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an level one advisor (L1) or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**5.3** The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance should be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance and other relevant circumstances. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  the entering of observations in individual performance evaluations;
3.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
4.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
5.  the reporting of suspected offences to responsible law enforcement agencies;
6.  the application of specific consequences as set out in applicable laws, codes of conduct, and DND and CAF policies and instructions;
7.  other administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee;
8.  other administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member; and
9.   the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board Framework for the Management of Compliance for additional information.
