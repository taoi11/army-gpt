3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** Information technology (IT) security is a key enabler for the achieving of well-managed information in support of programmes, business priorities and operations. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is essential to government decision making and the delivery of services. Effective IT security requires a systematic approach that identifies and categorizes information and associated assets, assesses risks, implements appropriate safeguards and establishes clear IT security accountabilities.

**3.2** The IT Security Programme in the DND and the CAF was established to manage the security of information, related IT assets and services against compromise. The IT Security Programme employs continuous security risk management to support the effective and efficient delivery of IT services and processes and is consistent with Government of Canada (GC) policies, directives and standards.

**3.3** The IT Security Programme requires that DND employees and CAF members work together in a concerted manner, along with the necessary processes and technologies, to achieve a high level of IT security in the DND and the CAF.

**3.4** As the IT security coordinator, the DIM Secur is the IT security authority for the DND and the CAF, and has a functional reporting relationship to both the ADM(IM), as the Chief Information Officer, and the Departmental Security Officer, in accordance with the Treasury Board (TB) _Operational Security Standard: Management of Information Technology Security (MITS)_.

**3.5** This DAOD should be read in conjunction with the _DND and CF IM and IT Policy Framework_ and other relevant ADM(IM) policies, instructions, directives, standards and guidance.

### Objective

**3.6** The objective of this DAOD is to establish the roles and responsibilities of DND employees and CAF members in respect of IT security.

### Expected Results

**3.7** The expected results of this DAOD are:

1.  increased awareness of IT security by DND employees and CAF members;
2.  demonstrated accountability over all IT security capabilities that are delivered in support of the DND and the CAF, in and outside Canada;
3.  integration by programme and service delivery managers of IT security requirements in plans, programmes, activities and services; and
4.  innovative and improved risk management to support and enable IT programmes and services.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**4.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the TB _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
