3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Risk_ establishes that departments and agencies must ensure the integration of risk management into the activities of their organizations.

**3.2** The Treasury Board _Operational Security Standard: Management of Information Technology Security (MITS)_ provides that departments must continuously manage the security risks to information and information technology (IT) assets throughout the life cycle of their programmes and services.

**3.3** IT security risks result from the exposure of IT systems and IT assets to the compromise of their confidentiality, integrity, availability, intended use and asset value by accidental or deliberate threats and natural hazards. IT security risk management is the process used to manage these risks.

**3.4** IT security risk management is one of several components of the IT Security Programme and the Departmental Security Program that the DND and the CAF need to perform as a routine part of their ongoing business and operations. IT security risk management is a key process in the delivery of secure and reliable IT services that support the mission and mandate of the DND and the CAF.

**3.5** This DAOD is part of the _DND and CF IM and IT Policy Framework_ and should be read in conjunction with other relevant ADM(IM) policies, instructions, directives, standards and guidance.

### Objectives

**3.6** The objectives of this DAOD are to:

1.  establish IT security risk management for programmes, systems and services;
2.  establish IT security risk management as an important business enabler within the decision-making process; and
3.  identify responsibilities for:
    1.  the identification, management, documentation and monitoring of IT security risks; and
    2.  providing direction and guidance on IT security risk management practices.

### Expected Results

**3.7** The expected results of this DAOD are:

1.  increased efficiency and transparency of IT security risk management processes;
2.  improved security risk management of IT systems and IT assets throughout the entire life cycle of the systems and assets;
3.  increased awareness and accountability for IT security risk decisions; and
4.  improved consistency in IT security risk management.

4\. Risk Management
-------------------

### General

**4.1** IT security risk management is a multifaceted undertaking that requires the involvement of DND employees and CAF members to establish DND and CAF objectives, define IT security requirements, develop IT security controls and operate secure IT systems that support DND business and CAF operations.

**4.2** The DND and CAF IT security risk management processes and activities have replaced the certification and accreditation (C&A) process with the assessment and authorization (A&A) process for IT-enabled projects and IT systems.

**4.3** The DND and CAF IT security risk management processes and activities:

1.  align with the processes and activities described in the _Information Technology Security Risk Management: A Lifecycle Approach (ITSG-33)_ of the Communications Security Establishment Canada, as well as integrate into all IT-enabled projects, IT systems and IT assets throughout the development life cycle; and
2.  ensure that key steps are performed on a continual basis throughout the life cycle of IT systems and IT assets, and ensure IT security risk management is applied from a DND and CAF perspective.

**4.4** IT security risk management enables the:

1.  IT security authority (SA) to identify the IT security risks associated with IT assets; and
2.  operational authority (OA) to make decisions on risk issues within their delegated area of responsibility.

**4.5** Within the DND and the CAF, IT security risk management is conducted by DIM Secur, as the DND and the CAF IT SA, with the support of the applicable IT system technical authority (TA) to:

1.  assess IT system security requirements;
2.  select and implement IT system security control profiles;
3.  monitor and assess IT security controls; and
4.  identify any required IT security control updates.

### Definition of IT Security Risk Management Requirements

**4.6** Managers at all levels must define their IT security risk management requirements to ensure that their IT systems and IT assets are appropriately protected from compromise.

### Selection and Deployment of IT Security Control Profiles

**4.7** The SA selects the appropriate IT security control profile that meets the requirements of the target IT system or IT asset. The OA, project manager or programme and service delivery manager must then consult DIM Secur to adjust specific IT security controls to meet the IT security requirements of the IT system or IT asset. The OA, project manager or programme and service delivery manager must subsequently implement the customized IT security control profile onto their IT system or IT asset.

### Monitoring and Assessment of IT Security Controls

**4.8** The SA, IT security practitioners and IT operational personnel must continually monitor and assess the performance of the implemented IT security controls in IT systems and IT assets, through the collection, consolidation and continual analysis of IT security control performance metrics. Monitoring IT security controls ensures that the selected IT security controls remain relevant and appropriate for the constantly changing threat environment.

**4.9** The SA, IT security practitioners and IT operational personnel must ensure that the OA, project manager or programme and service delivery manager, as applicable, is informed of any changes in the previously accepted risk level.

### Identification of IT Security Control Updates

**4.10** Based on the IT security control performance analysis, the OA may need to update the implemented IT security controls. The OA, in consultation with the SA and TA, may direct that the IT security controls be re-evaluated and adjusted until an acceptable level of residual risk is reached. The OA subsequently accepts the residual risk and the updated IT security controls are then implemented. Changes in any of the following could initiate an IT security control update:

1.  business or mission objectives;
2.  information sensitivity;
3.  IT security requirements;
4.  threat assessments or threat agents; and
5.  IT system or IT asset performance.

### Theatre of Operations IT Security Risks

**4.11** The nature of threats in a theatre of operations can differ greatly from the somewhat static perspective of a system-specific view. Although commanders have discretion in managing operational and tactical risks, the acceptance of significant IT security risks on the basis of operational efficiency must be weighed against the impacts to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information on IT systems. When a decision is made to accept a particular risk that affects the security of an IT system, the commander must report the factors leading to the acceptance of that risk to DIM Secur.

**4.12** B-GJ-005-502/FP-000, _Risk Management for CF Operations_, provides instruction on the decision-making process to assist commanders and their staffs in identifying, analyzing, evaluating and controlling all types of risk.

5\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**5.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
