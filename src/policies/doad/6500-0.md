3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** The modern defence environment requires that data be leveraged in all aspects of defence programs, at or near-real time, enhancing defence capabilities and speed and effectiveness in decision-making, and providing an information advantage during military operations.

**3.2** The DND and the CAF must therefore establish, govern and operationalize a defence data management function that provides robust governance of DND and CAF data and enables high-quality data to be leveraged as a strategic asset.

**3.3** The DND and the CAF must utilize their data to support the capability for analytics at all levels.

**3.4** The _CDS/DM Joint Directive on Data Management_ provides that ADM(DIA) is the functional authority for:

1.  data management, data governance, analytics and exploitation of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence; and
2.  the development and operationalization of the data and analytics program capability.

### Purpose

**3.5** This DAOD provides the strategic direction for DND and CAF policies, directives, instructions, standards and guidelines relating to data management and analytics.

### Policy Statement

**3.6** The DND and the CAF are committed to using and promoting data and analytics as strategic assets by:

1.  enabling authorized DND employees and CAF members to access, collect and manage data in all aspects of DND and CAF defence programs to enhance defence capabilities and reporting;
2.  enabling access and control of data across the DND and the CAF to provide insight, operational awareness, trust and effectiveness;
3.  enabling the optimisation of data for self-serve, near real-time analytics, visualisation, digital services and decision-making; and
4.  ensuring that data can be used for business intelligence, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence.

### Requirements

**3.7** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  create a culture whereby data is leveraged in all decisions, and all DND employees and CAF members are held accountable for their role in data management;
2.  support a data governance framework in which the roles and responsibilities of data stewards are delineated, monitored and audited;
3.  support a flexible risk-based security approach that balances the provision of greater internal access to data with the maintenance of data-centred security, ethics and protection of intellectual property rights;
4.  ensure that the privacy of individuals is protected in accordance with the Privacy Act, including in the context of data interoperability;
5.  develop and maintain an enterprise data model and related data glossaries and dictionaries to support decision-making, task effectiveness and efficiency of work, based on systems of record and authoritative data sources;
6.  align with Government of Canada policies, directives and practices on data governance, stewardship, enterprise and data architecture, and the management of master data, reference data, metadata and data quality;
7.  maintain data quality by entering accurate data into the appropriate systems of record in a timely manner and taking corrective action to address data integrity issues;
8.  ensure that data is managed to reduce redundancy and enable interoperability with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, allies and other government departments;
9.  ensure that data are stored in appropriately accredited repositories, commensurate with the security designations and markings of the relevant data;
10.  ensure that data are guarded against unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction;
11.  enable releasable, open data to be added to the Government of Canada’s Open Government portal, informed by public demand;
12.  ensure that data is managed in accordance with data retention and disposition directives, standards and guidelines; and
13.  support DND employees and CAF members in becoming data literate.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### General

**4.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
