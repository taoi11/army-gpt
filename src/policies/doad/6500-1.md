3\. Overview
------------

### Context

**3.1** The _CDS/DM Joint Directive on Data Management_ (the _Joint Directive_):

1.  provides that ensuring access to data to increase operational efficiency is a strategic objective for defence data management;
2.  directs ADM(DIA), as functional authority for data management and data governance, to introduce new policy instruments, standards and guidance to advance the strategic objectives of the _Joint Directive_;
3.  provides that level one (L1) organizations are expected to adopt a posture of data access by default within the DND and the CAF, withholding data only if they can articulate a specific operational risk to disclosure;
4.  provides that, with increased access to data across the DND and the CAF, comes the expectation that there will be increased vigilance and monitoring for unauthorized access or disclosure; and
5.  directs that Assistant Deputy Minister (Information Management) (ADM(IM)) will work with ADM(DIA) to develop and implement a risk-based data security approach to ensure that data can be easily accessible.

**3.2** The Treasury Board _Policy on Service and Digital_:

1.  outlines the responsibility of departments to maximize the release of their information and data as open resources, while respecting information security, privacy and legal requirements; and
2.  applies to all data created, collected, held, used, shared or managed in any repository or system, in any format, and at any point in the data life cycle, regardless of origin.

### Objective

**3.3** The objective of this DAOD is to establish the roles, responsibilities and processes to facilitate timely access to data for planning, operations, decision support, and research and development, in the DND and the CAF.

**Expected Results**

**3.4** The expected results of this DAOD in the DND and the CAF are:

1.  improved governance and management of data as a shared and strategic asset through a data stewardship model;
2.  the implementation of an access-by-default approach to data; and
3.  the implementation of a flexible, risk-based security approach to protect data from unauthorized access, use, sharing, disclosure, alteration or deletion.

4\. Management
--------------

### General

**4.1** The DND and the CAF must establish accurate, consistent, integrated and authoritative data that is managed as a shared and strategic asset to support the DND and CAF mandate.

### Process

**4.2** L1s must ensure that DND and CAF data in their organizations is:

1.  searchable and findable across DND and CAF platforms, through unique identifiers, accessible indices, catalogues, tools, knowledge and support, to enable data users to locate data;
2.  interoperable across different data domains and systems using shared terminology, metadata and reference data that allow for data content, context and meaning to be preserved;
3.  accessible to authorized users based on standardized processes for authentication and authorization;
4.  trusted by the use of enterprise-wide data quality and data governance frameworks, standards, platforms and tools;
5.  able to be securely shared to enhance operations and improve performance;
6.  usable for the purposes for which it is collected and capable of subsequent reuse in other contexts;
7.  secured from risks and threats such as unauthorized access, use, sharing, disclosure, alteration or deletion, using a flexible risk-based approach; and
8.  disposed of in accordance with established retention periods applicable to DND and CAF data.

### Data Access

**4.3** The DND and the CAF must promote timely data access and sharing through the development of policies, directives, instructions and standards.

**4.4** The DND and the CAF must protect security and privacy as required through role-based data access, appropriate authentication, authorization, encryption and an audit trail.

**4.5** Decisions on data access must be taken through the data governance structure established in the _Data Governance Framework_.

**4.6** Decisions about data access must be timely, transparent, documented and auditable.

### Monitoring

**4.7** ADM(DIA) must monitor the effectiveness of this DAOD.

### Disputes and Conflicts

**4.8** Any dispute over data access, or any conflict between the instructions in this DAOD and those in other instruments, should be referred to the Chief Data Officer, who will determine a process for resolution. The Defence Data Management Board (DDMB) has final decision-making authority on data access.

**4.9** Those with responsibility for data under the _Data Governance Framework_ may withhold access only if a specific operational risk, such as security, privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property concern, can be articulated.

5\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

### Compliance

**5.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military supervisors have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**5.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military supervisors for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may result in administrative action, including the imposition of disciplinary measures, for a DND employee, and administrative or disciplinary action, or both, for a CAF member. Non-compliance may also result in the imposition of liability on the part of Her Majesty in right of Canada, DND employees and CAF members.

**Note –** In respect to the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
