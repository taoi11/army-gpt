1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 1998-03-31

**Date of Last Modification:** 2007-08-10

**Application:** This DAOD is an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:** CFAO 59-1, _Affidavits and Statutory Declarations - Commissioned Officer's Authority Under Provincial Laws_

**Approval Authority:** Judge Advocate General (JAG)

**Enquiries:** Directorate of Law Military Personnel or the nearest JAG representative

2\. General Rules
-----------------

### Selection of Affidavit or Statutory Declaration

**2.1** The proper form to use for judicial proceedings is normally an affidavit, which is a statement made in writing sworn to or affirmed in front of a person having the authority to administer an oath or affirmation.

**2.2** In other circumstances, the appropriate form is normally a statutory declaration, which is a solemn declaration made in writing by a person believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath.

### Selection of Jurat

**2.3** The jurat is the clause at the bottom of an affidavit or statutory declaration that provides when, where and before whom the affidavit was sworn or affirmed or the statutory declaration was declared. The appropriate jurat is selected from those set out in the _Provincial and Territorial Statutory Authorities and Jurats_ map. Selection of the appropriate jurat, and its application to a blank affidavit or statutory declaration form, permit the use of these forms in any province or territory. Care shall be taken to:

1.  ensure that the conditions of the applicable provincial or territorial laws are met; and
2.  select the jurat for the province or territory in which the affidavit or statutory declaration is to be used.

**Example -** A CAF member at Canadian Forces Base Shilo, Manitoba, wishes to have an affidavit prepared for use in a court in the province of Alberta. The correct jurat to use is that for Alberta, not Manitoba.

**2.4** However, if an affidavit or statutory declaration is intended for use in any federal department or agency, for example, DND or the Department of Veterans Affairs, an affidavit or statutory declaration taken in any province or territory using the jurat applicable to that province or territory is acceptable.

**2.5** If the jurat provides a choice of bracketed words, the words not used shall be omitted or struck out.

### Caution as to Important Documents

**2.6** If important legal documents affecting civil matters are involved, for example, documents in respect of land, the distribution or liquidation of estates, or court proceedings, the deponent or declarant should, before completing the affidavit or statutory declaration, always obtain legal advice or specific instructions from the originator of the document.

**2.7** In some cases, a notary public may have to take the oath, affirmation or declaration.

### Limitations

**2.8** In respect of Quebec or Saskatchewan documents, a commissioned officer is only authorized to administer an oath or take an affirmation or statutory declaration for a CAF member.

### Admissibility in Evidence

**2.9** Under applicable provincial and territorial laws, documents may be admissible in evidence if certain conditions are met. To avoid problems as to the admissibility of documents, the jurat should always contain the officer's rank and unit below the signature of the officer taking the oath, affirmation or declaration.

### Penalty for Misuse

**2.10** Section 131 of the _Criminal Code_ provides that a person commits perjury by making a false statement with intent to mislead, under oath or solemn affirmation in an affidavit or statutory declaration, knowing that the statement is false. A person who commits perjury is guilty under section 132 of the _Criminal Code_ of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years.

**2.11** Section 138 of the _Criminal Code_ provides that certain improper activities in respect of affidavits or statutory declarations are indictable offences and punishable on conviction by imprisonment for up to two years.

**2.12** Section 125 of the _National Defence Act_ provides that a person who wilfully or negligently makes a false statement or entry in a document made or signed by that person and required for official purposes is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to less punishment.
