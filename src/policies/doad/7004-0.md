*   CFAO 59-4, _Compensation for Loss of or Damage to Personal Baggage Accepted for Shipment_
*   CFAO 205-5, _Military Foreign Service Regulations,_ Part 10_, Compensation for Damage or Loss of Furniture and Effects,_ Section 5, _Claims Procedures for Damage or Loss of F&E_

**Enquiries:** Director, Claims and Civil Litigation (DCCL) or the nearest representative of the Judge Advocate General (JAG).

2\. Definitions
---------------

**claims** (_réclamations_)

Claims include requests for compensation to cover losses, expenditures or damages sustained by the Crown or a claimant, including requests or suggestions that the Crown make an ex gratia payment.

Claims do not include claims made under other governing instruments or policies, for example:

*   under section 11 of the _Canadian Human Rights Act (Equal Wages)_;
*   from a contract dispute;
*   for loss and recovery of money;
*   for damage or loss to Crown servants' effects during travel or relocation that may be claimed under the public service or CAF integrated relocation programs; and
*   related to bodily injury while on duty.

**Crown servant** (_fonctionnaire de l'État_)

Crown servant has the same meaning as set out in the Treasury Board _Policy on Claims and Ex gratia Payments_ made by the Treasury Board. DND employees and CAF members are Crown servants. Persons engaged under contracts for services are not Crown servants.

**ex gratia payment** (_paiement à titre gracieux_)

Ex gratia payment means a benevolent payment made to anyone in the public interest by the Crown under the authority of the Governor in Council for loss or expenditure incurred for which there is no legal liability on the part of the Crown.

**personal property** (_effets personnels_)

Personal property means personal items which would normally be carried by a CAF member in a field pack or maintained in permanent or temporary quarters, e.g., basic clothing, radios, clocks, cameras, clothing, pictures, appliances, sports equipment, books and instruments.

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Policy Statement

**3.1** DND and the CAF are committed to providing reasonable and timely settlement and payment of claims made against the Crown.

**3.2** Every reasonable effort shall be made to obtain satisfaction of claims by the Crown, taking into account administrative efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### Requirements

**3.3** Claims against the Crown are assessed and paid as a liability of the Crown or on an ex gratia basis pursuant to the _Policy on Claims and Ex gratia Payments_. An ex gratia payment may not be made if there is a statutory, regulatory or policy basis for compensation.

**3.4** DND employees and CAF members should secure adequate insurance to pay for the replacement cost of their personal property located in DND accommodation as the Crown may not be legally liable in respect of a claim for loss or damage to such property.

4\. Authorities
