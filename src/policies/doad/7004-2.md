*   CFAO 59-4, _Compensation for Loss of or Damage to Personal Baggage Accepted for Shipment_
*   CFAO 205-5, _Military Foreign Service Regulations,_ Part 10_, Compensation for Damage or Loss of Furniture and Effects,_ Section 5, _Claims Procedures for Damage or Loss of F&E_

2\. Definitions
---------------

**basic clothing** (_habillement de base_)

Basic clothing means military items of clothing for which replacement is provided from clothing upkeep allowance.

**claims** (_réclamations_)

Claims include requests for compensation to cover losses, expenditures or damages sustained by the Crown or a claimant, including requests or suggestions that the Crown make an ex gratia payment.

Claims do not include claims made under other governing instruments or policies, for example:

*   under section 11 of the _Canadian Human Rights Act_ (_Equal Wages_);
*   from a contract dispute;
*   for loss and recovery of money;
*   for damage or loss to Crown servants' effects during travel or relocation that may be claimed under the public service or CF integrated relocation programs; and
*   related to bodily injury while on duty.

**Crown servant** (_fonctionnaire de l'État_)

Crown servant has the same meaning as set out in the Treasury Board _Policy on Claims and Ex gratia Payments_. DND employees and CAF members are Crown servants. Persons engaged under contracts for services are not Crown servants.

**Ex gratia payment** (_paiement à titre gracieux_)

Ex gratia payment means a benevolent payment made to anyone in the public interest by the Crown under the authority of the Governor in Council for loss or expenditure incurred for which there is no legal liability on the part of the Crown.

**personal property** (_effets personnels_)

Personal property means personal items which would normally be carried by a CAF member in a field pack or maintained in permanent or temporary quarters, e.g., basic clothing, radios, clocks, cameras, clothing, pictures, appliances, sports equipment, books and instruments.

3\. Loss or Damage to Personal Property
---------------------------------------

### Crown Servant Effects

**3.1** Claims for loss or damage to Crown servant effects which are reasonably related to the performance of the servant's duties may be made under the _Policy on Claims and Ex gratia Payments_.

### Personal Property

**3.2** Compensation may be claimed under Section 1 (_Compensation For Loss of or Damage to Personal Property_) of CBI Chapter 210 (_Miscellaneous Entitlements and Grants_) if the loss or damage to the personal property of a CAF member was attributable to the service of the member and the personal property lost or damaged was necessary for the performance of military duties of the member.

### No Compensation Payable

**3.3** No compensation is payable under this DAOD for:

1.  items of clothing or material issue for which a commanding officer (CO) may authorize free replacement issue in accordance with A-LM-007-014-AG-001, _Canadian Forces Supply Manual_;
2.  cash, jewellery, fur coats, precious metals, gem stones, or coin, stamp or gun collections, except under exceptional circumstances; or
3.  items covered by private insurance.

### Replacement Value

**3.4** Compensation for loss or damage to Crown servants' effects or personal property is based on the full cost to replace the effects with effects of the same or equivalent quality, or the reasonable cost to repair them, whichever is the more appropriate.

4\. Submission of Claims
------------------------

### Submission

**4.1** Claims made under the _Policy on Claims and Ex gratia Payments_ by a CAF member or other Crown servant, or under CBI 210.03, _Claims for Compensation_, by a CAF member, shall be submitted as follows:

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1
 | The Crown servant shall submit a claim to the CO or departmental manager in the form of a statutory declaration, with applicable additional documents attached, setting out:

*   full particulars of the circumstances under which the loss or damage occurred, substantiated by evidence as appropriate, including, if applicable:
    *   a description of the incident;
    *   statements from other Crown servants and persons having knowledge of the circumstances;
    *   any other existing written reports or information in relation to the incident; and
    *   an itemized list of the articles lost or damaged, showing:
        *   month, year and place of purchase;
        *   purchase price;
        *   general condition of the article at time of loss or damage, e.g., poor, fair, good or excellent;
        *   the amount claimed with respect to each article; and
        *   if available, original receipts for the items claimed;
*   in the case of a claim under CBI 210.03, the information required under paragraph (1) of CBI 210.03;
*   in the case of glasses or safety footwear, the actual receipt representing the cost of the replacement item, as well as the amount of any footwear allowance paid to the DND employee, if applicable;
*   a written undertaking that the CAF member will comply, if compensation is paid, with CBI 210.06, _Recovery For Articles For Which Compensation Paid,_ and CBI 210.07, _Assignment of Legal Rights_, if applicable;
*   evidence that the loss or damage was promptly reported and that every reasonable effort was made to recover the missing articles;
*   a statement by the claimant as to any private insurance coverage or lack of it, and the details of any settlement made by the insurance company; and
*   any further information and material as may be required for a legal opinion.

**Note -** Claims may be submitted in bulk if the cause of the loss or damage was the same for all claimants, such as a fire or an explosion.

 |
| 2

 | The CO or department manager to whom a claim has been forwarded shall:

*   review the documents to ensure that all applicable supporting documentation has been provided;
*   in the case of a claim under CBI 210.03, _Claims for Compensation_:
    *   ensure that it represents a valid claim; and;
    *   certify the claim in accordance with subparagraph (1)(g) of CBI 210.03, _Claims for Compensation,_ and that, in the case of bulk claims, the claims submitted represent all the claims arising from the incident. If such a certification in the case of bulk claim cannot be made, the CO shall provide a statement indicating the reasons why all claims are not forwarded together, including a projected date as to when the remaining claims may be expected;
*   in the case of claims made under the _Policy on Claims and Ex gratia Payments_, provide written confirmation that the Crown servant's effects related to the reasonable performance of the duties of the Crown servant at the time of the loss or damage; and
*   forward the claim and supporting documentation directly to the nearest regional JAG representative or, in the case of a DND employee or CF member located in the National Capital Region, to the DND/CF LA, Attention: DCCL, with their recommendation as to whether payment should be approved.

 |
| 3

 | The nearest regional JAG representative or DCCL reviews the claim to assess the amount of compensation payable, and actions payment as appropriate.

 |

### Statutory Declaration

**4.2** The statutory declaration required under Step 1 of the _Submission_ block shall be completed in accordance with DAOD 7000-1, _Completion of Affidavits and Statutory Declarations._

5\. Special Cases
-----------------

### Service Laundries and Dry Cleaning Establishments

**5.1** A-LM-007-014-AG-001, _Canadian Forces Supply Manual_, prescribes the conditions under which personal property may be accepted for laundering, dry cleaning and pressing services on a recoverable basis.

**5.2** Claims by CAF members arising from the use of a service laundry or dry cleaning establishment should be submitted in accordance with form DAOD 7004-2A, _Declaration of Loss or Damage to Laundry and Dry Cleaning_.

**5.3** If the laundry or dry cleaning establishment is operated by a contractor, claims procedures under the contract shall be followed.

**5.4** Compensation for loss or damage to laundry or dry cleaning shall be recommended on the basis of:

1.  wear remaining in the article;
2.  normal expected lifetime of the article; and
3.  the responsibility of the laundry and dry cleaning establishment with relation to the stability of the fabric used in the manufacture of the article.

### Loss or Damage to Personal Property or Baggage

**5.5** Compensation may be paid from public funds for loss or damage to personal property or baggage belonging to Crown servants and dependants, or any other person authorized to travel on military transportation facilities, if the loss or damage has occurred after acceptance by a Crown servant for shipment by military means. A request for compensation for such loss or damage should be submitted using form DAOD 7004-2B, _Declaration of Loss or Damage to Personal Property or Baggage_.

**5.6** If a CAF member, because of location, arranges shipment of unaccompanied baggage directly with a commercial carrier, the Crown does not assume responsibility.

### Losses Incurred Outside Canada

**5.7** Claims made under section 25 (_Emergency Evacuation and Loss_) or section 26 (_Compensation for Damage or Loss of Furniture and Effects_) of CBI Chapter 10 (_Military Foreign Service_) shall be submitted to DCCL with the following:

1.  a copy of the emergency evacuation order, if applicable;
2.  the most recent CFIRP inventory;
3.  a statutory declaration setting out an itemized list of any other articles lost or damaged if purchased after the CFIRP inventory, including:
    1.  month, year and place of purchase;

    3.  general condition of the article at time of loss or damage, e.g., poor, fair, good or excellent;
