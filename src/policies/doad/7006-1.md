3\. Making an Entry
-------------------

### General

**3.1** An entry must be made on a CAF member's conduct sheet, form CF 459, for the following:

1.  a conviction:
    1.  for a service offence under the _Code of Service Discipline_;
    2.  by a court in Canada dealing with criminal matters; or
    3.  by a foreign court or tribunal;
2.  a finding that a CAF member has committed a service infraction; or
3.  brave conduct or meritorious service.

### Conviction by a Court in Canada Dealing with Criminal Matters

**3.2**  Any conviction by a court in Canada dealing with criminal matters for an offence committed under the following must be entered on a CAF member’s conduct sheet:

1.  any statute of Canada, for example, the _Criminal Code_; or
2.  a provincial statute or local ordinance, when the sentence of the civil court is a term of imprisonment, not suspended, but not if the term of imprisonment is a default provision not served.

**Note:** The following situation is an example: A sentence under a provincial statute of a $100 fine with five days imprisonment in default of payment would not be entered on a conduct sheet unless the period of imprisonment was served.

**3.3** An entry must be made for the reversion in the rank of a non-commissioned member resulting from a conviction by a civil authority (see _Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces (QR&O)_ article 11.11_, Reversion Upon Conviction by a Civil Authority_).

### Conviction by a Foreign Court or Tribunal

**3.4** Any conviction of a CAF member by a foreign court or tribunal that would, if it had taken place in Canada, be punishable under the _National Defence Ac_t (NDA), the _Criminal Code_ or any other Act of Parliament, must be entered on the CAF member’s conduct sheet.

### Information to be Omitted

**3.5** No entry may be made on the conduct sheet if a court martial or civil court directs that an offender be discharged absolutely (see section 203.8 of the NDA or section 730 of the _Criminal Code_). Court costs and surcharges must not be entered on a conduct sheet.

**Note -** The following situation is an example: If a civil court awards a CAF member a sentence of a fine of $1,000 for impaired driving with a court surcharge of $50, only the fine of $1,000 is to be entered on the conduct sheet.

### Brave Conduct or Meritorious Service

**3.6** The following brave conduct or meritorious service by a CAF member must be entered on their conduct sheet:

1.  acts of military valour or bravery, meritorious service or distinguished conduct recognized through the award of any of the following:
    1.  Order of Military Merit
    2.  a Military Valour Decoration;
    3.  a Canadian Bravery Decoration;
    4.  a Meritorious Service Decoration;
    5.  Mention in Dispatches;
    6.  a commendation listed in the Canadian Medals Chart; and
    7.  a Commonwealth or foreign honour; and
2.  acts of military valour or bravery, meritorious service or distinguished conduct that are not recognized through an official honour but that a CO wishes to record on the conduct sheet, including commanding officer commendations.

### Enrolment of Former Member and Component Transfer

**3.7** When a former CAF member is enrolled, entries from the conduct sheet used during the CAF member's previous service must be entered on a new conduct sheet. When a CAF member transfers from one component to another, a new conduct sheet is not created as the existing conduct sheet must be transferred to the CAF member’s new unit.

4.Changes to a Conduct Sheet
----------------------------

### Removal of an Entry – Conviction of a Service Offence under the _Code of Service Discipline_

**4.1** An entry relating to a conviction of a service offence must be removed from a CAF member's conduct sheet if:

1.  a record suspension for the conviction in question is ordered under the Criminal Records Act by the Parole Board of Canada (see _DAOD 7016-0, Record Suspension_);
2.  an appeal or review sets aside a finding of guilty; or
3.  three years have passed since the CAF member was convicted of a service offence that is not a criminal offence (see section 249.27 of the NDA). 

**Note –** If an entry is removed from a CAF member’s conduct sheet because an appeal or review sets aside a finding, and a subsequent appeal or review reinstates the finding, an entry will again be made on the conduct sheet.

**4.2** An entry relating to a conviction of a service offence which has resulted in a fine of $200 or less, or a minor punishment, for example, seven days confinement to barracks, must be removed from a CAF member's conduct sheet if:

1.  the CAF member has completed the later of:
    1.  six months of service from the date of enrolment or re-enrolment; or
    2.  initial military occupation training;
2.  12 months have passed during which no other conviction has been entered;
3.  the CAF member is promoted to the rank of sergeant, or an officer cadet or a non-commissioned member attains commissioned rank; or
4.  the CAF member is to be released from the CAF without having completed initial military occupation training.

### Removal of an Entry – Service Infraction

**4.3** An entry relating to a service infraction must be removed from a CAF member's conduct sheet if:

1.  a review quashes a finding that the CAF member has committed the service infraction;
2.  the CAF member has completed the later of:
    1.  six months of service from the date of enrolment or re-enrolment; or
    2.  initial military occupation training;
3.  12 months have passed since the CAF member was found to have committed the service infraction, unless the CAF member has been found to have committed another service infraction under the same QR&O article (for example, under any subparagraph of QR&O article _120.03, Infractions in Relation to Military Service_), in which case all entries must be removed 12 months after the date of the latest entry; or
4.  the CAF member is promoted to the rank of sergeant, or an officer cadet or a non-commissioned member attains commissioned rank.

### Removal of an Entry – Foreign Conviction

**4.4** An entry resulting from a conviction by a foreign court or tribunal must be removed from a CAF member's conduct sheet if the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) determines that the entry is no longer required in the interests of the CAF. The CAF member must apply in writing for such a determination. The application must be supported by the CAF member's CO. Normally, this will not be considered before completion of a period of five years of service following the conviction.

### Removal of an Entry – Brave Conduct or Meritorious Service

**4.5** An entry must be removed from a CAF member's conduct sheet if a decision is taken that results in the forfeiture of an award for brave conduct or meritorious service that is entered on the conduct sheet.

### Removal Administration

**4.6** When an entry is removed, any remaining entries must be entered on a new conduct sheet. The old conduct sheet must be destroyed.

### Disposal of Disciplinary Documents

**4.7** Any record of disciplinary proceedings, charge report, charge sheet, certificate of conviction or equivalent certificate pertaining to a removed entry must be removed from the CAF member's service records and retained in accordance with applicable document retention and disposal procedures. The CAF member must be informed by the unit of these actions.

**Amendment of a Conduct Sheet Entry**

**4.8** An entry in a CAF member’s conduct sheet must be amended if one of the following occurs:

1.  a punishment of a court, court martial or summary trial is varied;
2.  a sanction of a summary hearing is varied;
3.  the nature or serving of a sanction, including by way of suspension, revocation of suspension, commutation, mitigation, remission or substitution, is affected; or
4.  a sentence that was previously suspended is put into execution.

**Note –** Summary trials are replaced by summary hearings with the implementation of Bill C-77.
