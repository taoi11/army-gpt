Section 2 - Policy Direction
===============

2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1**  The purpose of the military justice system is to maintain the discipline, efficiency, and morale of the CAF. The continuous modernization of the military justice system ensures it reflects current Canadian values and aligns with developments in the civilian justice system.

**2.2**   This DAOD is intended to provide supplementary direction that will assist the chain of command (CoC) to properly administer military justice at the unit level.

**2.3**   The summary hearing (SH) process is the CoC’s primary tool for maintaining the discipline, efficiency, and morale of the CAF through the investigation, charging, and adjudication of service infractions at the unit level. Essential aspects of the SH process are largely prescribed in the _National Defence Act_ (NDA) and the _Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces_ (QR&O). Supplementary direction and guidance to the applicable NDA and QR&O provisions are set out in the _Military Justice at the Unit Level Policy_ (MJUL Policy).

#### Policy Statement

**2.4**  The CoC must ensure that CAF members who perform duties in the administration of military justice at the unit level are familiar with the SH process in the NDA, the QR&O, the MJUL Policy and any other pertinent directives, orders and instructions.

### Requirements

**2.5** The CoC must ensure that:

a. CAF members who will potentially be called upon to perform duties in the administration of military justice at the unit level are familiar with the NDA, the QR&O, the MJUL Policy and any other pertinent directives, orders and instructions;

b. superior commanders, commanding officers, and delegated officers hold a valid certification from the JAG attesting to successful completion of the MJUL course within the last four years, in order to perform Officer Conducting Summary Hearing duties in the administration of military justice at the unit level; and

c. assisting members for persons charged with having committed a service infraction hold a valid certification from the JAG attesting to successful completion of the MJUL course within the last four years, except if the person charged with having committed a service infraction has been informed and accept their assisting member’s lack of training and certification.

3\. Consequences
----------------

#### General

**3.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements, or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, CAF members may seek direction through their CoC. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the CAF to ensure that it is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
