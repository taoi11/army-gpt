### Context

**3.1** The term "next of kin" (NOK) normally means a person's spouse, common-law partner, child or parent.

**3.2** Form DND 2587, _Next of Kin (NOK) Identification Form_, permits a CAF member to identify a Next of Kin (NOK) as defined by QR&O article 1.02, _Definitions_. However, the identification of primary and secondary NOK does not provide that person with any power or duty as an executor, liquidator of the succession or administrator for the purposes of the distribution of the estate of a deceased CAF member or the disposition of the remains.

### Policy Statement

**3.3** The CAF shall collect and safeguard:

1.  the service estate of a member of the Regular Force;
2.  the service estate of a member of the Reserve Force if the member dies during Class "B" or "C" Reserve Service; and
3.  the personal belongings of a CAF member when the CAF member is reported missing or is released with unsound mind.

**3.4** The above actions shall not be taken in respect of any part of the service estate located in family living accommodation, or already in the care or custody of the NOK, the executor or the liquidator of the succession unless, in the opinion of the Director of Estates, the circumstances make such action necessary for their safekeeping.

### Requirements

**3.5** A committee of adjustment shall be appointed within 48 hours of the death of a CAF member.
