1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 1998-03-31

**Date of Last Modification:** 2014-02-03

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:** CFAO 59-5, _Memoranda of Understanding_

**Approval Authority:** Judge Advocate General (JAG)

**Enquiries:** National Defence Memoranda of Understanding Coordinator (NDMOUC)

2\. Definitions
---------------

**domestic memorandum of understanding** (_protocole d'entente national_)

A memorandum of understanding with another federal government department, a Crown corporation or agency, province, territory or municipality or, on an exceptional basis, a non-government organization, an industry association or a commercial entity within Canada. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 43050)

**international memorandum of understanding** (_protocole d'entente international_)

A memorandum of understanding with a foreign armed force, military alliance or command within an alliance, a department or ministry of a foreign government, an international organization or, on an exceptional basis, an international non-government organization, a foreign industry association or a foreign commercial entity.  
  
**Note –** Examples of participants in an international MOU include the United Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and North American Aerospace Defence Command. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 43116)

**memorandum of understanding** (MOU) (_protocole d'entente (PE)_)

A written, approved, non-contractual, non-legally binding arrangement that may be developed at any level within the DND and the CAF, by which the DND or the CAF and other participants external to the DND and the CAF decide to cooperate in a project, program or similar undertaking. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 43137)

3\. Operating Principles
------------------------

### Staffing of Related Documents

**3.1** Amendments and annexes to an MOU and other related documents such as implementing arrangements, supplementary arrangements, technical arrangements or any other similar documents, whether they are stand-alone arrangements or created under the terms of an existing MOU, are subject to the staffing provisions applicable to an MOU as provided for in this DAOD.

### MOU Participants

**3.2** When the DND concludes an MOU, it is in the name of the Minister of National Defence (MND) or the DND. When the CAF concludes an MOU, it is in the name of the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). If the MOU is with a foreign government, that participant must be described as being represented by the minister, ministry, department or armed forces of that state.

### Advice and Consultations

**3.3** Legal, financial and acquisition authority advice must be obtained by the DND or CAF MOU office of primary interest (OPI) during the MOU initiation phase. Additionally, consultations with subject-matter legal advisors and the NDMOUC may occur during the preparation phase. During the completion phase, the formal MOU review process must be carried out, including review by the NDMOUC as well as the finance, security and legal advisors. All reviews must be completed before any MOU is approved.

### Recordkeeping

**3.4** For all MOUs having financial implications, records must be maintained to ensure that there is an audit trail of the authorization for and use of the MOU.

### MOUs Which May Result in the Acquisition of Goods or Services

**3.5** While an MOU is the formalization of a cooperative working arrangement, it is not an authority document nor a procurement or contracting instrument. If activities agreed upon by the MOU participants result in the DND or the CAF being required to make financial payments or barter exchanges (e.g. replacement in-kind, equal value exchange or a combination of same), that result in the acquisition of goods or services, the DND or CAF MOU OPI must consult with the appropriate legal and financial advisors within their level one (L1) advisor organization.

**3.6** When an MOU will result in the acquisition of goods or services, the DND or CF MOU OPI must follow the appropriate guidance in either the _Procurement Administration Manual_ or _Pro__ject Approval Directive (DAP)_, or the applicable _Financial Administration Manual_ chapters, early in the MOU initiation process to determine the appropriate financial, contracting, and applicable project authorities and approvals that must be sought, dependent on the scope of activity.

**3.7** In the acquisition of any goods or services, the DND or CAF MOU OPI must ensure compliance with all applicable federal laws and government policies, and applicable Treasury Board policies and directives, including those listed in the _References_ section of this DAOD.

### Mutual Logistics Support Arrangements (MLSAs)

**3.8** MLSAs are highly flexible international MOUs designed to facilitate the reciprocal provision of logistics support, supplies and services between cooperating defence forces. DND or CAF MOU OPIs who anticipate developing an MLSA must be aware of the _Interim Policy Direction – Mu__tual Logistics Support Arrangements_.

### Negotiating MOUs

**3.9** Because other participants to an MOU are guided by their own policies, DND or CAF MOU OPIs negotiate within the limits of federal laws and government policies, to achieve an arrangement satisfactory to all participants.

**3.10** For recordkeeping purposes, DND and CAF MOU OPIs must report the status of all MOUs to the NDMOUC on an annual basis.

### Coordination and Consultation on International MOUs

**3.11** The NDMOUC must coordinate with the Director International and Operational Law (DIOL) in the Office of the JAG regarding consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) on international MOUs.

4\. Initiation Phase
--------------------

### Process

**4.1** The following table describes the MOU initiation phase. The appropriate legal advisor must be consulted by the DND or CAF MOU OPI before moving on to the MOU preparation phase (see section 5).

| Who does it | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| The DND or CAF MOU OPI
 | 

*   Identify the need to formalize an arrangement;
*   Identify the aim and the scope of the foreseen arrangement;
*   Consult with the appropriate legal advisor to obtain confirmation that an MOU is the appropriate instrument to achieve the desired goal;
*   Consult with the NDMOUC to confirm whether or not a similar MOU is already in existence, obtain a relevant template and MOU staffing process information;
*   Consult their L1 advisor organization chief of staff (COS) and comptroller to confirm resource allocation (source and sufficient level of funding) as well as confirmation of recovery or payment mechanism with the Director Corporate Submissions and Financial Arrangements (DCSFA);
*   Determine the security implications of the MOU and ensure that they are addressed adequately in the MOU;
*   Consult DCSFA to confirm financial authority and tax requirements;
*   Consult with the appropriate legal advisor and any other requisite authorities, such as the Director Materiel Policy and Procedures (DMPP), to determine whether there are any acquisition of goods or services implications;
*   For MOUs which may result in the acquisition of goods or services, see paragraphs 3.6 to 3.8; and
*   Following consultation with the above organizations, the OPI may initiate the drafting of the MOU with the external participant or participants.

 |
| The appropriate legal advisor

 | 

*   Ensure that an MOU is the appropriate instrument to achieve the desired goal.

 |
| The NDMOUC

 | 

*   Establish whether an arrangement already exists between the participants that may accomplish what needs to be done, such as a mutual logistics support MOU between DND and the United States Department of Defense;
*   Provide guidance including, if required, a copy of the _Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) Writing Guidelines_; and
*   Provide suitable examples of similar existing MOUs.

 |

5\. Preparation Phase

 | 

*   Ensure that all stakeholders have been consulted and the MOU has been:
    *   drafted in accordance with the _Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) Writing Guidelines_; or
    *   if the MOU was drafted by an external participant, reviewed and amended as necessary by DND or CAF MOU OPI in accordance with the _Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) Writing Guidelines_;
*   Ensure all necessary internal reviews are carried out. Example: if an OPI in the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS) organization is preparing an MOU dealing with out-of-Canada secondment, consultation with the Chief of Military Personnel will be required. Other officials will be consulted as appropriate, including the COS or comptroller of the L1 advisor organization of the OPI, as well as the responsible budget manager; and

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**7.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual  
non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance. Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
