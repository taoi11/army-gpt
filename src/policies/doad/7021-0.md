**Supersession:**

*   CPAO 7.10, _Conflict of Interest_
*   CFAO 19-7, _Civil Employment – Military Personnel_
*   CFAO 19-37, _Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Compliance Measures_
*   NDHQ Policy Directive P5/89, _Conflict of Interest Supplementary Compliance Measures_

**Approval Authority:** Chief Review Services (CRS)

**Enquiries:** Director Defence Ethics Programme (DDEP)

2\. Definitions
---------------

**conflict of duties** (_tâches conflictuelles_)

A conflict that arises, not because of a DND employee’s or CF member’s private interests, but as a result of one or more concurrent or competing official responsibilities. For example, responsibilities associated with their primary official duties compete with their responsibilities in a role outside of DND or the CF, such as an appointment to a board of directors, or other outside function, when that role is also part of his or her official duties. (_Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_)

**non-defence agency** (_organisme externe_)

An organization or individual outside Defence, including another government department, another level of government, the government and armed forces of other countries, institutions, commercial businesses, or non-profit organizations. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 46396)

**organizational conflict of interest** (_conflit d’intérêts organisationnel_)

A situation in which the action or decision of a DND employee or CF member calls into question the integrity, objectivity, impartiality or non-partisanship of the DND or the CF. As a result, the situation could be perceived by a reasonable observer as placing the DND or the CF in a conflict of interest with the public interest. A real organizational conflict of interest is defined as existing at the present time in a situation; an apparent organizational conflict of interest could be perceived by a reasonable person to exist in the situation, whether or not it is the case; and a potential organizational conflict of interest could reasonably be foreseen to exist in the future. An apparent organizational conflict of interest is just as serious as a real or potential organizational conflict of interest. (_Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_)

**outside activity** (_activité extérieure_)

Any employment or political or charitable activity, whether remunerated or not, that is conducted outside the official working hours of a DND employee or the authorized hours of duty or service of a CAF member. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 693780)

**personal conflict of interest** (_conflit d’intérêts personnel_)

A situation in which a DND employee or CF member has private interests that are not an integral part of their public role and that could improperly influence the performance of his or her official duties and responsibilities or in which the DND employee or CF member uses his or her office for personal gain. A real conflict of interest is defined as existing at the present time in a situation; an apparent conflict of interest could be perceived by a reasonable observer to exist in a situation, whether or not it is the case; and a potential conflict of interest could reasonably be foreseen to exist in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise in the following circumstances: outside activities (including political activities); acceptance of gifts, hospitality and other benefits; post-employment activities; and any other activity or decision incompatible with the official duties and responsibilities of a DND employee or a CF member. An apparent PCOI is just as serious as a real or potential PCOI. (_Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_)

**sponsorship** (_parrainage_)

An arrangement between the DND or the CAF and a non-defence agency under which, in exchange for public acknowledgement or other non-monetary benefit, the non-defence agency provides financial resources or in-kind assistance to the DND or the CAF in support of a particular DND or CAF event or initiative. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 693781)

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** The Treasury Board (TB) _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_ has been established pursuant to subsection 5(1) of the _Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act_. This Code and the TB _Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment_ replaced the TB _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service_ in 2012.

**3.2** The TB _Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment_ requires that deputy heads identify and manage operational risks of conflict of interest (COI) and delegate the responsibilities and authorities for the policy’s implementation.

**Note –** In this DAOD, a COI is an organizational COI, a personal COI or a conflict of duties, as applicable.

**3.3** DND employees and CAF members are subject to applicable principles, rules and procedures set out in the DAOD 7021 series, as well as to applicable principles, rules and procedures set out in the _Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_. DND employees are also subject to the TB _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_ and the _Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment_.

### Policy Statement

**3.4** The DND and the CAF are committed to the avoidance, prevention and resolution of COIs involving DND employees and CAF members as one of the principal means of maintaining public trust and confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the DND and the CAF.

### Requirements

**3.5** The DND and the CAF must:

1.  establish measures to prevent the possibility of COI arising from outside activities, post-employment, sponsorships, donations and the performance of duties or responsibilities;
2.  identify and manage operational risks of COI and COI risks associated with the pursuit of post-employment;
3.  implement a process to deal with COI and post-employment;
4.  issue directives and orders to make all DND employees and CAF members aware of the meaning and intent of all COI and post-employment provisions; and
5.  resolve any COI or risk arising from post-employment in the broader public interest.

**3.6** The DDEP must notify the CRS of any non-compliance with this DAOD.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**4.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members, as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the TB _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
