1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2000-07-07

**Date of Last Modification:** 2015-05-06

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Supersession:**

*   CPAO 7.10, _Conflict of Interest_
*   CFAO 19-37, _Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Compliance Measures_
*   NDHQ Policy Directive P5/89, _Conflict of Interest Supplementary Compliance Measures_

**Approval Authority:** Chief Review Services (CRS)

**Enquiries:** Director Defence Ethics Programme (DDEP)

2\. Definitions
---------------

**conflict of duties** (_tâches conflictuelles_)

A conflict that arises, not because of a DND employee’s or CF member’s private interests, but as a result of one or more concurrent or competing official responsibilities. For example, responsibilities associated with his or her primary official duties compete with his or her responsibilities in a role outside of DND or the CF, such as an appointment to a board of directors, or other outside function, when that role is also part of his or her official duties. (_Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_)

**organizational conflict of interest** (_conflit d’intérêts organisationnel_)

A situation in which the action or decision of a DND employee or CF member calls into question the integrity, objectivity, impartiality or non-partisanship of the DND or the CF. As a result, the situation could be perceived by a reasonable observer as placing the DND or the CF in a conflict of interest with the public interest. A real organizational conflict of interest is defined as existing at the present time in a situation; an apparent organizational conflict of interest could be perceived by a reasonable person to exist in the situation, whether or not it is the case; and a potential organizational conflict of interest could reasonably be foreseen to exist in the future. An apparent organizational conflict of interest is just as serious as a real or potential organizational conflict of interest. (_Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_)

**personal conflict of interest** (_conflit d’intérêts personnel_)

A situation in which a DND employee or CF member has private interests that are not an integral part of their public role and that could improperly influence the performance of his or her official duties and responsibilities or in which the DND employee or CF member uses his or her office for personal gain. A real conflict of interest is defined as existing at the present time in a situation; an apparent conflict of interest could be perceived by a reasonable observer to exist in a situation, whether or not it is the case; and a potential conflict of interest could reasonably be foreseen to exist in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise in the following circumstances: outside activities (including political activities); acceptance of gifts, hospitality and other benefits; post-employment activities; and any other activity or decision incompatible with the official duties and responsibilities of a DND employee or a CF member. An apparent personal conflict of interest is just as serious as a real or potential personal conflict of interest. (_Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_)

**significant official dealings** (_relations officielles importantes_)

Any dealings with any person or entity, external or internal to the DND or the CAF, that are conducted by a DND employee or CAF member in the course of their official duties or responsibilities, whether directly or through a subordinate, including dealings of a commercial nature and interactions where an exchange of information may occur. This does not include contacts which are strictly of a social nature. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 693782)

3\. Overview
------------

### General Expectation

**3.1** Upon cessation of their employment or service, all DND employees and CAF members are expected to avoid situations which could give rise to a conflict of interest (COI) with respect to their most recent official duties without unduly restricting their ability to seek employment.

**Note –** In this DAOD, a COI is an organizational COI, a personal COI or a conflict of duties, as applicable.

### Persons Subject to Specific Restrictions

**3.2** This DAOD establishes specific post-employment restrictions applicable to:

1.  any DND employee occupying a position classified at EX minus 1 or above;
2.  any Regular Force officer of the rank of lieutenant-colonel or commander or above;
3.  any Reserve Force officer of the rank of lieutenant-colonel or commander or above serving on Class “B” or Class “C” Reserve Service; and
4.  any incumbent of a position designated as being subject to post-employment compliance measures.

**3.3** The post-employment limitations in this DAOD do not apply to the Deputy Minister (DM), the Associate DM, the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), the Judge Advocate General (JAG), the Principal of the Royal Military College of Canada or a military judge. These persons are reporting public office holders who are subject instead to the provisions of the _Conflict of Interest Act_ and should consult with the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner in order to obtain information pertaining to their post-employment obligations.

### Interpretation

**3.4** In this DAOD, a “person with post-employment restrictions” is any person referred to in paragraph 3.2 but not an office holder referred to in paragraph 3.3.

4\. Post-Employment Restrictions
--------------------------------

### Restricted Activities

**4.1** Any person with post-employment restrictions is subject to a one-year post-employment limitation period during which time the person must not, without a waiver or reduction of the limitation period or the restrictions:

1.  make contact directly in any capacity, including that of an observer, with the DND or the CAF on behalf of themselves or any external entity or individual;

**Note –** This does not include any inquiry made by the person as a private citizen by means of a point of contact normally available to the public.

2.  make contact directly in any capacity, including that of an observer, with any other Government of Canada (GC) organization, on behalf of themselves or any external entity or individual, if the person with post-employment restrictions had significant official dealings with that GC organization, including any meeting on a joint project with that organization, at any time during the period of one year immediately prior to the cessation of their DND employment or CAF service;
3.  accept employment with an external entity or individual with which the person had significant official dealings at any time during the last year of their DND employment or CAF service; or
4.  give advice to an external entity or individual, or new employer, using information that is not publicly available concerning the programs or policies of the DND, the CAF or any other GC organization in which the person was employed or with which the person had significant official dealings.

**4.2** The one-year post-employment limitation period for a person with post-employment restrictions commences:

1.  the first day of retirement, or first day after resignation or termination from the public service, whichever comes first, in the case of a DND employee;
2.  the first day of retirement leave or release, whichever comes first, in the case of a Regular Force officer; and
3.  the day following the end of Class “B” or Class “C” Reserve Service, or release from the CAF, whichever comes first, in the case of a Reserve Force officer.

**4.3** In addition to the restrictions in this DAOD associated with the one-year post-employment limitation period, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) also requires that any bidder on a contract with the GC be free of COI. In accordance with PWGSC _Standard Instructions – Goods or Services Competitive Requirements_, clause 18 – _Conflict of Interest – Unfair Advantage_, a contract bid may be rejected on the basis of a COI or the appearance of a COI or if a person, such as a DND employee or CAF member, has worked on the statement of requirements or statement of work for a GC project and the person is employed or was employed by the company bidding on the contract.

### Limitations if in Receipt of a Pension, Lump Sum Payment or Early Departure Allowance

**4.4** Treasury Board (TB) has set specific limits on DND authority to award a contract to any person in receipt of a pension under the _Public Service Superannuation Act_, but not if solely in receipt of a pension under the _Canadian Forces Superannuation Act_ or the _Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act_. These limits are set out in A-FN-100-002/AG-006, _Delegation of Authorities for Financial Administration for the Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)_. For any amount above the specific limits, TB approval is required prior to awarding a contract.

**4.5** In accordance with A-FN-100-002/AG-006, a DND employee, former DND employee, CAF member or former CAF member must satisfy COI and post-employment obligations regarding any contract offered to them. As a result, CRS must be consulted in writing prior to making a contractual commitment. Form DND 2840-E, _Post-Employment Declaration_, must be used for this purpose.

**4.6** Regardless of the value of the proposed contract, any former DND employee in receipt of a pension under the _Public Service Superannuation Act_, a lump sum payment or an early departure allowance, may be subject, in accordance with A-FN-100-002/AG-006, to fee abatement. The Director Materiel Policy and Procedures is to be consulted with respect to the terms and conditions of such a contract.

5\. Compliance
--------------

### Disclosure Process

**5.1** To ensure compliance with this DAOD, a person with post-employment restrictions must disclose to the DDEP, using form DND 2840-E:

1.  all offers of employment from any external organization with which they have had significant official dealings at any time during the last year prior to their retirement, resignation, termination or release;
2.  all offers of employment from any external organization having dealings with the GC;
3.  any offer of employment that they accept, without exception; and
4.  any intention to provide professional services to the DND, the CAF or any other GC organization with which they had significant official dealings at any time during the last year of their DND employment or CAF service.

**5.2** The disclosure is processed as follows:

 |
| CRS | 

*   advise a DND employee occupying a position classified at or above EX-03 if a contract of employment or professional services contract may be pursued or accepted; and

 |
| DDEP |

**5.4** Supervisors must closely monitor the official dealings of their subordinates to ensure compliance with this DAOD.

6\. Waiver or Reduction of a Post-Employment Limitation Period or Restrictions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Application to the DM or the CDS

**6.1** A person who is subject to a one-year post-employment limitation period may apply to the DM or the CDS, as applicable, for a waiver or reduction of the limitation period or the applicable restrictions in section 4. The application may be made:

1.  simultaneously with the disclosure of a prospective contract of employment, or professional service contract, if performance of the contract could violate one or more post-employment restrictions; or
2.  after the person has been advised that a prospective contract of employment or professional services contract would violate one or more post-employment restrictions.

### Criteria for Waiver or Reduction

**6.2** When balancing the broader public interest with the risk to the integrity of the DND and the CAF, the DM or the CDS may grant a waiver or reduction, taking into consideration the following:

1.  the extent of any underlying COI risk and the potential for adverse public perception of the integrity of the DND or the CAF;
2.  the existence of an identifiable and important benefit which would accrue to the DND or the CAF as a result of the requested waiver or reduction being granted;
3.  the potential for the prospective employer or client to gain an unfair commercial or private advantage;
4.  the sensitivity of information possessed by the person by virtue of their employment, former employment, service or former service;
5.  the extent of the person’s authority and influence within the DND or the CAF;
6.  the circumstances under which the person’s employment or service ended;
7.  the person’s general employment prospects;
8.  the presence of any undue hardship created by the post-employment restrictions;
9.  the disposition of similar cases; and
10.  any other considerations that the DM or the CDS considers relevant.

**6.3** On the basis of the above criteria, a waiver or reduction may be granted with or without further restrictions.

**6.4** Any person with post-employment restrictions is permitted to take steps to be assigned new duties before their departure from the DND or the CAF with the intent of seeking a waiver or reduction of their one-year limitation period. Approval by the manager or CO of such a reassignment of duties is subject to DND priorities and the exigencies of the service.
