1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2001-06-26

**Date of Last Modification:** 2015-02-17

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authorities:**

*   Deputy Minister (DM)
*   Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS).

**Enquiries:** Director Defence Ethics Programme (DDEP)

2\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**2.1** The DND and the CAF are integral parts of the democratic society of Canada and must reflect its values. Fundamental to the effectiveness of the DND and the CAF is the strength and vitality of its ethical culture. By its nature, national defence involves the possible use of force in response to the full spectrum of defence and security challenges. Canadians expect DND employees and CAF members to consistently perform their duties to the highest ethical standards.

**2.2** The Defence Ethics Programme (DEP) provides the DND and the CAF with the focus, frameworks and processes to guide, assess and improve ethical practices and behaviours in the workplace and during operations. The DEP is a values-based programme which aims to ensure sound ethical practices and decision-making by DND employees and CAF members. It also strives to strengthen and protect the ethical integrity of the DND and the CAF as institutions, and that of DND employees and CAF members as individuals.

### Policy Statement

**2.3** The DND and the CAF have a special responsibility for the defence of Canada, its people and its parliamentary democracy. Discharging this responsibility requires, among other things, a commitment by the DND and its employees, and the CAF and its members, to apply the highest ethical standards in all decisions and actions, whether at home or abroad.

### Requirements

**2.4** To ensure compliance by DND employees and CAF members with the ethical principles, values and expected behaviours set out in the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics (DND and CF Code of Values and Ethics), the DND and the CAF must provide:

1.  a comprehensive framework to assist DND employees and CAF members in maintaining ethical standards;
2.  objective standards for defence values and ethics upon which to base defence leadership and management; and
3.  clarification of ethical expectations to guide conduct and decision-making.

**2.5** The DDEP must notify the Chief Review Services (CRS) of any non-compliance with this DAOD.

3\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**3.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
