1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2001-06-26

**Date of Last Modification:** 2015-02-17

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Review Services (CRS)

**Enquiries:** Director Defence Ethics Programme (DDEP)

2\. Overview
------------

### General

**2.1** The Defence Ethics Programme (DEP) provides a comprehensive framework to assist DND employees and CAF members in maintaining the highest ethical standards. In order to work effectively together, the DND and the CAF must operate from ethical principles, values and expected behaviours that provide a common basis for all DND employees and CAF members, while respecting the terms and conditions of employment of DND employees and the terms of service of CAF members. The DEP also provides direction, guidance and support to DND employees and CAF members to foster ethical practices in the workplace and during operations.

**2.2** The DEP is a values-based ethics programme that considers the unique circumstances and requirements of the DND and the CAF. The defence values and ethics are set out in the _Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics (DND and CF Code of Values and Ethics)_ and its related Statement of Defence Ethics, both of which are consistent with principles, values and expected behaviours contained in the Treasury Board _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_ and in A-PA-005-000/AP-001, _Duty with Honour: The Profession of Arms in Canada_.

**2.3** The values-based approach places importance on core principles and values and uses them as standards for professional conduct. The emphasis is on behaviour requirements rather than merely focusing on compliance with rules.

**2.4** The _DND and CF Code of Values and Ethics_ includes provisions with respect to conflict of interest, post-employment, civil employment and outside activities, the acceptance of gifts, hospitality and other benefits, as well as public solicitations, sponsorships and donations. The DAOD 7021 series sets out detailed policies and instructions in these areas for DND employees and CAF members.

3\. Defence Ethics Programme
----------------------------

### Objectives

**3.1** The objectives of the DEP are to:

1.  foster an ethical culture within the DND and the CAF;
2.  establish and maintain a framework that effectively supports the desired ethical culture and is aligned with the values and ethics for the public sector set out in the _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_ and the Treasury Board _Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment_;
3.  develop, implement and maintain the _DND and CF Code of Values and Ethics_, and ensure that it is consistent with the _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_ and with the military ethos in A-PA-005-000/AP-001;
4.  provide a management structure with a clear set of goals and sufficient resources; and
5.  establish mechanisms to assist DND employees and CAF members to raise, discuss and resolve ethical issues.

### Elements

**3.2** The DEP consists of the following elements:

1.  the _DND and CF Code of Values and Ethics_ and its related _Statement of Defence Ethics_, which clearly communicate and provide direction and guidance on defence values and ethics and set a standard of expected behaviours;
2.  the _Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Ethics Plan (DND and CF Ethics Plan)_, which provides guidance on the mechanisms to oversee and evaluate the effectiveness of the DEP;
3.  a leadership commitment from senior DND management and CAF commanders to the DEP;
4.  the means for the assessment and management of organizational ethical risks and for the handling of ethics cases;
5.  a strategy to address incentives, programme awareness, ethics training, self-learning, discussion and open dialogue;
6.  a range of tools to assist DND employees and CAF members in recognizing ethical situations and making ethical decisions;
7.  a safe and flexible range of options to voice concerns or to provide an ethical voice, taking into consideration varying ethical situations and circumstances;
8.  a range of measures to provide prompt resolution of ethical concerns, taking into consideration varying situations and circumstances;
9.  an oversight mechanism that includes performance measurement;
10.  a programme improvement mechanism to enact programme changes as required;
11.  an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB); and
12.  periodic defence ethics surveys.

**3.3** The EAB is established by the CRS, and consists of persons appointed as level one (L1) ethics coordinators by each L1 advisor and others who may be designated by the CRS.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**4.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

### Failure by DND Employees to Comply

**4.2** A DND employee who fails to comply with this DAOD, the _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_ or the _DND and CF Code of Values and Ethics_ may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment under DAOD 5016-0, _Standards of Civilian Conduct and Discipline_.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
