1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2001-11-30

**Date of Last Modification:** 2010-08-31

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members) who exercise any authority of the Deputy Minister (DM).

**Approval Authority:** Chief Review Services (CRS)

**Enquiries:** Principal Internal Disclosure Office (PIDO)

2\. Definitions
---------------

| In this DAOD … | have the same meaning as in … |
| --- | --- |
| 
*   protected disclosure; (**divulgation protégée**)
*   public servant; (**fonctionnaire**)
*   reprisal; and (**représailles**)
*   wrongdoing (**acte répréhensible**)

 | subsection 2(1) of the _Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act_ (PSDPA). |

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** In the course of performing their duties, DND employees may perceive that a wrongdoing has been committed or is about to be committed in their workplace, or they may be asked to commit a wrongdoing. The PSDPA provides for the disclosure of wrongdoings by DND employees and other public servants and prohibits the taking of a reprisal against a public servant who has made a protected disclosure or, in good faith, has cooperated in an investigation. The DM has designated the CRS as the senior officer responsible for implementing the PSDPA.

**3.2** Detailed information on the implementation of the PSDPA is set out in the:

1.  _Internal Disclosure of Wrongdoing - Guidelines for CF Supervisors, DND Managers and Employees_ (available on the CRS intranet site); and
2.  DAOD 7024-1, _Internal Procedures for Disclosure of Wrongdoings in the Workplace_.

**3.3** A CAF member is not a public servant for purposes of the PSDPA and may therefore not make a disclosure under the PSDPA. For information concerning CAF members acting as supervisors of DND employees, and disclosures by DND employees in respect of wrongdoings by CAF members, see DAOD 7024-1.

### Policy Statement

**3.4** The DND is committed to ensuring that:

1.  internal procedures exist that encourage DND employees to disclose, in good faith, information concerning alleged wrongdoing in the workplace;
2.  any DND employee who makes a protected disclosure is treated fairly and protected from reprisals;
3.  disclosures concerning alleged wrongdoing are addressed in an appropriate and timely fashion;
4.  DND employees are made aware of their choice to disclose wrongdoing to their supervisor, the CRS as the senior officer, or the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner; and
5.  DND employees are made aware of and understand their rights and responsibilities under the PSDPA.

### Requirements

**3.5** The DND shall:

1.  establish internal procedures for receiving and dealing with disclosures concerning alleged wrongdoing in the workplace;
2.  ensure that DND employees understand the requirement for the responsible use of government information; and
3.  promote ethical practices and a positive environment for the disclosure of wrongdoings.
