3\. Overview
------------

**General**

**3.1** _The Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act_ (PSDPA) provides for DND employees and other public servants to come forward if they believe that a wrongdoing has been committed or is about to be committed in their workplace, or if they have been asked to commit a wrongdoing. The PSPDA:

1.  prohibits the taking of reprisals against a public servant who has made a protected disclosure or, in  
    good faith, has cooperated in an investigation; and
2.  provides a fair and objective process for any person alleged to be responsible for a wrongdoing.

**3.2** Section 8 of the PSDPA provides that the PSDPA applies in respect of the following wrongdoings in or relating to the public sector:

1.  a contravention of any Act of Parliament or of the legislature of a province, or of any regulations made  
    under any such Act, other than a contravention of section 19 of the PSDPA;
2.  a misuse of public funds or a public asset;
3.  a gross mismanagement in the public sector;
4.  an act or omission that creates a substantial and specific danger to the life, health or safety of  
    persons, or to the environment, other than a danger that is inherent in the performance of the duties or functions of a public servant;
5.  a serious breach of a code of conduct established under section 5 or 6 of the PSDPA; or
6.  knowingly directing or counselling a person to commit any of the above wrongdoings.

**Note –** The Treasury Board _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_ and the _Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Code of Values and Ethics_ have been made for purposes of sections 5 and 6 respectively of the PSPDA.

**The PSDPA and DND Employees**

**3.3** To implement the PSDPA, the DM has established internal procedures and processes which permit the disclosure of wrongdoings by DND employees with confidence that they will be treated fairly and protected from reprisals.

**Public Sector Integrity Commissioner**

**3.4** The PSDPA has established the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner (PSIC). Any public servant or member of the public may disclose information to the PSIC about alleged wrongdoing.

**3.5** Under subsection 19.1(1) of the PSPDA, only the PSIC may deal with a complaint made by a public servant or a former public servant that a reprisal has taken place against the public servant or former public servant as a result of the making of a protected disclosure or, in good faith, cooperating in an investigation. The complaint may also be made by a person designated by the public servant or former public servant for that purpose.

**Confidentiality**

**3.6** The DND is required under the PSDPA to:

1.  protect, subject to any other Act of Parliament and the principles of procedural fairness and natural  
    justice, the identity of persons involved in the disclosure process, including that of:
    1.  the person making the disclosure;
    2.  witnesses; and
    3.  the person alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing; and
2.  establish procedures to ensure the confidentiality of information collected in relation to a disclosure  
    under the PSDPA.

**_Access to Information Act_ and _Privacy Act_**

**3.7** In order to protect the identity of persons involved in the disclosure process, the _Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act_ were amended to provide that the head of a government institution is required to refuse to disclose any record requested under either of these Acts that contains information created for the purpose of making a disclosure under the PSDPA or in the course of an investigation into a disclosure under the PSDPA.

4\. Implementation of the _Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act_
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**DND Disclosure Organizational Structure**

**4.1** The DM has designated the ADM(RS) as the senior officer responsible for the implementation of the PSDPA. The DSEI assists the ADM(RS) in this role. To ensure that there is effective, fair and impartial day-to-day management of the disclosure of wrongdoings, the ADM(RS) has established the Internal Disclosure Office (IDO).

**Choices for Making a Disclosure**

**4.2** A DND employee may make a disclosure under the PSDPA to:

1.  their supervisor;
2.  the ADM(RS); or
3.  the PSIC.

**Note –** A disclosure made to the ADM(RS) should be forwarded to the IDO.

**Disclosure to the Public**

**4.3** In accordance with section 16 of the PSDPA, a disclosure that a public servant may make under sections 12 to 14 of the PSPDA may be made to the public if there is not sufficient time to make the disclosure under those sections and the public servant believes on reasonable grounds that the subject-matter of the disclosure is an act or omission that:

1.  constitutes a serious offence under an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of a province; or
2.  constitutes an imminent risk of a substantial and specific danger to the life, health and safety of persons, or to the environment.

**CAF Members Acting as Supervisors of DND Employees**

**4.4** A DND employee may make a disclosure to a CAF member if the CAF member acts as their supervisor and exercises any authority of the DM. A CAF member may exercise the authority of the DM in several areas, including:

1.  supervision, staffing, leave approval and other personnel functions in respect of DND employees; and
2.  financial matters under the _Financial Administration Act_.

**4.5** If a DND employee is uncertain as to whether the CAF member acting as their supervisor exercises any authority of the DM, the DND employee should contact the IDO.

**Wrongdoing by CAF Members**

**4.6** As the CAF is an organization that is excluded from the definition of “public sector” for purposes ofthe PSDPA, a DND employee may not make a protected disclosure as to wrongdoing that is in or relating to the CAF. However, a DND employee may make a protected disclosure in respect of a wrongdoing by a CAF member in respect of the exercise of any authority of the DM by that CAF member.

**Disclosure Made to a Supervisor or the ADM(RS)**

**4.7** The DND is committed to promoting openness and dialogue within the workplace so that DND employees who have concerns about wrongdoings can raise the matter informally using the usual reporting relationship.

**4.8** Should a DND employee wish to make a disclosure under the PSDPA, the DND employee may request information and assistance from the IDO on the PSDPA and advice on making a disclosure.

**4.9** There are five basic steps, as summarized in the following table, in the internal procedures for a disclosure made to a supervisor or the ADM(RS) (see the Disclosure of Wrongdoing – Guidelines for Department of National Defence (DND) Managers and Employees, and Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Supervisors and Members for a complete description of each step):

| Step | Action | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Disclosure of wrongdoing | The DND employee discloses wrongdoing to their supervisor or the ADM(RS).
The supervisor who receives the disclosure must report it to the IDO. The IDO must ensure that all disclosures are:

*   logged in the IDO database;
*   given a file identifier number; and
*   acknowledged in writing.

**Note –** A DND employee should normally not engage another organization or process while a disclosure is being reviewed or investigated.

 |
| 2 | Preliminary assessment | The IDO, or the supervisor in consultation with the IDO if appropriate, must:

*   review the information received;
*   apply the definition of “wrongdoing”;
*   determine if there are sufficient grounds for further action; and
*   if so, take action in accordance with step 3.

If a disclosure is rejected, the DND employee must be informed in writing and a copy sent to the IDO.

 |
| 3 | Review or Investigation | The IDO must make a decision as to the appropriateness of conducting an informal review or if the disclosure should be referred to another organization or process.

The supervisor or IDO may conduct the review.

If a formal investigation is required, the disclosure should normally be referred to the DSEI for action. However, a supervisor may conduct an investigation if the supervisor received the disclosure.

 |
| 4 | Reporting | At the conclusion of a review or investigation, the supervisor, IDO or DSEI must provide:

*   a finding as to the validity of the disclosure; and
*   a written report to the ADM(RS).

The ADM(RS) must review the results of the report and decide how best to disseminate the report's findings and recommendations.

If the ADM(RS) determines that corrective action is required, applicable senior authorities in the DND must take the corrective action and inform the ADM(RS) when the action is taken. The IDO must follow up as required.

 |
| 5 | Communication of disclosure outcome | Once a report has been finalized and approved, the supervisor, IDO or ADM(RS), as appropriate, must notify in writing, subject to the provisions of the _Access to Information Act_ and _Privacy Act_, the DND employee who made the disclosure and other relevant parties, including persons who have been implicated in the alleged wrongdoing, of the outcome of the review or investigation and of any corrective action that has been taken.

In the event that a review or investigation finds wrongdoing as a result of the disclosure, paragraph 11(1)(c) of the PSDPA requires that certain information be made public. In respect of a disclosure concerning the DND, this information is posted on the ADM(RS) Internet and intranet sites.

 |

**Disclosure by DND Employee Working in the Office of the DND/CAF Ombudsman**

**4.10** If a DND employee working in the Office of the DND/CAF Ombudsman makes a disclosure of wrongdoing to their supervisor or the ADM(RS) and the wrongdoing relates to that Office, the ADM(RS) must engage an independent investigator from outside of the DND and the CAF to conduct the investigation. Based on the findings of the investigator, the ADM(RS) must take action as considered appropriate.

5\. Consequences
----------------

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**5.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance with this DAOD may be investigated. The nature and severity of consequences resulting from non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.

6\. Responsibilities
