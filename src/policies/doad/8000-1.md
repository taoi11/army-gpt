[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/8000-series/8000/8000-1-conduct-explosive-ordnance-disposal.html#wb-tphp)

5\. Operating Principles for Operations
---------------------------------------

### EOD Coordination and Response in Canada

**5.1** The Comd CJOC has overall responsibility for the conduct of EOD in Canada.

**5.2** Comds of RJTFs are responsible for the coordination of the disposal of Def EO, including UXO, in Canada. The applicable Comd coordinates the receipt of an EOD request and the response.

### EOD Coordination and Response Outside Canada

**5.3** The Comds of CJOC and CANSOFCOM have overall responsibility for the conduct of EOD by CAF members in their applicable operational commands when deployed outside Canada.

**5.4** The Comd of a task force outside Canada directs and coordinates EOD in accordance with the concept of operations set out in B-GJ-005-316/FP-001 and B-GJ-005-316/FP-101, _Improvised Explosive Device Disposal_.

### Assistance by DND Employees

**5.5** As described in paragraphs 9 to 14 of Ammunition and Explosives Instruction #15 (Change 2), _Recognized Civilian Qualifications Applicable to Ammunition and Explosives Employment_, currently qualified DND employees may be employed on work to conduct the following EOD-related activities:

1.  destruction of UXO;
2.  destruction of surplus or obsolete ammunition and explosives at a CAF ammunition facility;
3.  destruction of dud or misfired ammunition on CAF ranges and training areas;
4.  support to authorized engineering tests and trials;
5.  support to research and development;
6.  third-level screening of munitions scrap;
7.  free from explosives inspection of dummy and display ammunition; and
8.  assisting, in the role of a Number 2, a properly qualified CAF EOD operator with the pick-up and destruction of stray ammunition (see paragraphs 5.12 and 6.3 of this DAOD).

### Assistance by Contractors

**5.6** A CO must not permit a contractor to dispose of Def EO or non-Def EO during any EOD operation or tasking directed by the CAF. This prohibition does not apply to UXO legacy site programmes and contracted UXO work on active RTAs.

### CAF Members of the Reserve Force

**5.7** Reserve Force units do not contain EOD teams. However, CAF members of the Reserve Force may be trained to fulfill EOD roles. Requests to train CAF members of the Reserve Force must be submitted to the CFEOD.

### Response to an EOD Incident on a Defence Establishment

**5.8** The Comd of a base, wing or station, the CO of an HMCS or the OIC of any other defence establishment not located on a base, wing or station, e.g. a recruiting centre, must make plans, in consultation with their RJTF and CJOC, for responding to EOD incidents on their defence establishment.

### Approval of ALEA Requests

**5.9** CAF assistance to provincial police forces for IEDD outside a defence establishment requires a Class 1 or 3 CFAPPFD request. A Class 1 request may only be approved by the MND. In accordance with the approval authority granted to the CDS by the MND, operational Comds are delegated authority to approve Class 3 support requests. This delegation of approval authority may not be delegated further.

**5.10** In any case in which the distinction between a Class 1 or 3 request is vague or the nature of the CAF assistance could be contentious, the ALEA request must be referred for guidance to the Comd CJOC.

**5.11** CAF assistance to a federal LEA for IEDD outside a defence establishment may be provided pursuant to:

1.  subsection 273.6(2) of the NDA, with the approval of the request by the Governor in Council or the MND; or
2.  the CFAAD, with the approval of the request by the MND.

**5.12** A Comd or CO must ensure that only EOD operators (CAF members certified to conduct EOD) and currently qualified DND employees (see subparagraph 5.5.h), using approved equipment, are assigned in support of a request by a LEA to conduct EOD. The Comd CJOC may direct training for EOD operators in consultation with RCN, CA and RCAF representatives in preparation for a specific domestic operation.

**Note –** A DND employee would only be so employed if there was an insufficient number of EOD operators in the immediate geographic area of the unit to generate a minimum of a two-person EOD team. The DND employee would only be employed as a Number 2.

**5.13** The Comd of an RJTF or delegated representative may authorize participation in collective training with civil authorities to:

1.  foster an understanding of CAF domestic operational capabilities and EOD procedures; and
2.  increase realism through the simulation of CAF-civil authority interaction.

**5.14** A Comd or CO must not engage in any planning that promises or implies a pre-commitment of DND or CAF resources.

**5.15** The neutralization and subsequent disposal of Def EO is a routine defence activity as part of the "cradle to grave" management approach to Def EO and is not to be confused with support to a LEA. When CAF authorities are advised by a LEA of discarded "war trophies" or recovered Def EO, any subsequent CAF EOD action is conducted as a routine operation.

### Request from an OGD – Disposal of Hazardous Chemicals

**5.16** The Comd of an RJTF may respond to a request from Environment Canada, NRCan, Public Safety Canada or OGD, which may not have EOD resources, to provide assistance in the disposal of hazardous chemicals. This support may be provided under the B-GS-055-000/AG-001, _Provision of Services to Non-Defence_ _Agencies_, if it does not involve ALEA.

**5.17** A request for assistance is coordinated between the CJOC continental watch officer and the requesting OGD.

### Def EO Disposal Capability

**5.18** The CO of a defence establishment is responsible for the maintenance of a resident Def EO disposal capability. However, not every base, wing, station or HMCS has a resident EOD capability with EOD operators. Comds of RJTFs are to maintain a list of CMD and IEDD capable resources within their area of responsibility.

### Release of Information

**5.19** A DND employee or CAF member must not, without authority, release any information that may compromise the operational security of EOD capabilities, equipment or tactics.

**5.20** Any request for the personal information of an EOD operator, such as name or home address, must be forwarded to the Director Access to Information and Privacy_._ The CJOC and CFEOD are to be advised.

**5.21** Any display or demonstration of EOD capabilities must conform to EOD information security standards. The OIC of the CFEOD may be contacted for further guidance.

6\. Disposal
------------

### Disposal of Def EO

**6.1** The Comd of the geographically nearest base, wing or station or CO of an HMCS is responsible for the collection and disposal of Def EO on a defence establishment. Disposal of Def EO outside a defence establishment will be actioned when requested by a LEA.

**6.2** If EOD operators are not available at the base, wing, station or HMCS, the tasking must be forwarded to the applicable RJTF HQ for coordination and execution.

**6.3** Only CAF members whose MOC or occupation specialty specification allows them to conduct EOD may be tasked for the disposal of Def EO. In exceptional circumstances, a currently qualified DND employee may be tasked to assist an EOD operator in the disposal of Def EO. A DND employee may not assist when the item in question is determined to be an IED.

### Disposal of EO Other Than Def EO

**6.4** The responsibility for the disposal of EO other than Def EO is set out in the following table:

| The disposal of ... | is the responsibility of ... |
| --- | --- |
| non-Def EO located on a defence establishment
 | the defence establishment or directed to the nearest defence establishment or LEA with disposal capability.

Any request for LEA assistance must be made to the Comd CJOC through the RJTF HQ.

 |
| non-Def EO located outside a defence establishment

 | the applicable LEA.

Depending on which LEA is involved, the CAF may be requested to provide disposal assistance in accordance with the Class 1 or 3 approval process, subsection 273.6(2) of the NDA or the CFAAD.

 |
| EO, including IED or UXO, during a deployment outside of Canada

 | the task force Comd, or the Comd CANSOFCOM for any deployment conducted by special operations forces.

 |

**Note –** A LEA may not have the capability to positively identify if an item is Def EO or not, or to certify that an item suspected of being Def EO is free from explosive, non-hazardous or safe to handle and hold. If any doubt exists as to the true nature of an item (e.g. locally-manufactured hand grenades or landmines), the item will be treated as Def EO and disposed of accordingly.

### Deviations

**6.5** This DAOD does not preclude an EOD operator from using whatever TTPs are necessary or local resources that are available if such action, after confirmation with the chain of command, is necessary to save lives.

**6.6** Any deviation from standard EOD TTPs for a planned operation must be:

1.  requested in writing prior to a trial, evaluation or operation; and
2.  forwarded to the OIC of the CFEOD for approval.

[Top of Page](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/8000-series/8000/8000-1-conduct-explosive-ordnance-disposal.html#wb-tphp)

7\. Exceptional Hazard Allowance and Improvised Explosive Device Bonus
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### EHA Approval and Payment

**7.1** The conditions governing the payment of the EHA are set out in CBI 205.38, _Exceptional Hazard Allowance_ (_EHA_).

**7.2** The Comd of an RJTF is the approving authority for the payment of EHA in a domestic operation.

**7.3** The Comd CJOC is the approving authority for the payment of EHA in a deployment outside Canada.

**7.4** The advice of the CJOC may be sought as to entitlement to EHA. Requests for EHA that remain in contention will be directed to the CFEOD through CJOC.

**7.5** No more than two CAF members may normally receive EHA for a given incident.

**7.6** Once EHA approval has been received, the CAF member submits a claim for EHA through the unit orderly room using a CF 52 Form, _General Allowance Claim_, with financial code 2202ZA C103 01222. Only a CO may certify that the claimant was ordered to carry out the specific EOD action.

**7.7** The CFEOD must be informed of all approved EHA claims by the approval authority that is administering the claim.

### IED Bonus

**7.8** The conditions governing the payment of the IED bonus are set out in CBI 210.94, _Improvised Explosive Device Bonus – Regular Force_. A CAF member submits a claim for the IED bonus through the unit orderly room using a CF 52 Form, with financial code 2202ZA C103 01222.

**7.9** The IED bonus is taxable but is not subject to deductions for superannuation purposes.

**7.10** Forfeiture of the IED bonus may be imposed in accordance with QR&O article 208.318, _Forfeiture of Improvised Explosive Device Bonus – Regular Force_.

**7.11** If a CAF member who is paid the IED bonus does not complete, for any of the reasons set out in QR&O subparagraphs 208.318(_a_) to (_c_), the period for which the IED bonus was paid, the amount of the forfeiture must be calculated as follows:

Total amount of bonus received X Months of service remaining ÷ total months of the period of service for the bonus = Repayment amount

### Reattendance on EOD Courses and Retesting

**9.5** Given the critical and dangerous nature of EOD, the CO of a CAF member who is unsuccessful on an EOD course must ensure that the CAF member receives unit mentoring, training and experience prior to returning for a second attempt. Only the OIC of the CFEOD may approve more than two attempts to complete an EOD course. A third attempt should only be considered in exceptional circumstances. This does not apply to a CAF member who ceased training for a medical or compassionate reason.

**9.6** If the training establishment responsible for EOD professional standards assesses that a CAF member lacks the competency to work safely in an EOD environment, the CAF member may not be nominated for further EOD training unless approved by the OIC of the CFEOD.

**9.7** Multiple attempts in a test setting on an EOD course are not reflective of real world performance. Therefore, testing must not permit more than two attempts on a performance check, with any exceptions approved on a case-by-case basis.

10\. Certification and Recertification
--------------------------------------

### General

**10.1** Upon successful completion of recognized EOD training or FMOST, a CAF member is certified as an EOD operator and may conduct EOD during a three-year period. On behalf of the CFEOD, the DtD CoE issues an IEDD certification card that is valid for the three-year period. The card is only required for domestic IEDD response to a LEA request, in order to prove that a CAF member is certified.

**10.2** A recertification solicitation message is automatically generated to the applicable operational or environmental command HQ. Recertification nominations are to be submitted to the CFEOD 45 days in advance of a course start. The CFEOD reviews all nominations and coordinates prioritization for course loading.

**10.3** An EOD operator should recertify prior to the expiry of the certification period. Should this prove impossible, the OIC of the CFEOD may, on a request for service reasons from the EOD operator's chain of command, grant an extension of certification for a period of up to one year for the EOD operator to successfully complete the recertification programme.

**10.4** An EOD operator who fails to complete the recertification programme loses their certification and is no longer permitted to act as the team operator or Number 1 during an operation. The EOD operator may, however, continue to train with their unit and be employed as an assistant or Number 2 until successfully completing the recertification programme.

**10.5** If a CO determines that an EOD operator is no longer competent to conduct EOD, the CO of the unit must rescind the EOD operator's certification and advise the OIC of the CFEOD. The EOD operator's log must also be annotated to reflect the rescinding of the certification. The EOD operator may still be employed as a Number 2, but is not permitted to conduct EOD operations as a Number 1 until successfully completing a formal recertification serial.

### Voluntary Withdrawal

**10.6** If a CAF member no longer wishes to serve as an EOD operator, the EOD operator may submit a request for voluntary withdrawal to their CO. The request must stipulate the EOD operator's reason for the withdrawal. The OIC of the CFEOD must be informed of all withdrawals. A CO who receives a request by a CAF member to be reinstated as an EOD operator must submit the request to the OIC of the CFEOD, recommending that the CAF member attend a formal recertification serial. The CO's recommendation must include a statement indicating that the circumstances surrounding the CAF member's voluntary withdrawal have been resolved.

### Maintaining and Monitoring Operational Readiness

**10.7** An EOD operator who has completed certification or recertification is considered operationally ready if:

1.  the CO of the EOD operator determines that the EOD operator has met the proficiency standards in the regular exercise of the EOD skill-set within successive three-month periods during the three-year period; and
2.  the EOD operator has met any other readiness standards that may be set by a Comd of a command.

**10.8** An operational or environmental Comd must take appropriate measures when an EOD operator does not meet the proficiency standards. The senior EOD advisor for the applicable operational or environmental command HQ may consult the CFEOD in these circumstances.

**10.9** An EOD operator who fails to meet the proficiency standards in the regular exercise of the EOD skill-set must complete a series of EOD scenarios to the satisfaction of the senior EOD operator appointed for the unit by the CO. Upon successful completion, the CO must forward notification of reinstatement of proficiency status to the senior EOD advisor for the operational or environmental command HQ.

### Suspected or Confirmed Impairment

**10.10** Any physical or mental health issue, or use of certain drugs, may potentially impair an EOD operator's capability to maintain a high degree of concentration and attention. Given the potential consequences of any impairment in EOD, the EOD operator and the supervisor and CO of the EOD operator must ensure that any impairment or suspected impairment is reviewed without delay by a medical officer. In any case in which impairment is confirmed, the CO must, in consultation with the senior EOD operator of the unit, suspend that EOD operator's certification until such time, subject to paragraph 10.11, as the EOD operator is determined fit by a medical officer to return to EOD duties. Impairment of an EOD operator's capability may result from:

1.  a physical health issue such as a traumatic brain injury, an acute or chronic injury associated with significant pain, a cardiac arrhythmia, the use of a prescription medication such as an opioid, antinauseant or sleep aid that may impair concentration, or a neurological condition associated with tremor, reduced sensation or strength; or
2.  a mental disorder (e.g. major depression, panic disorder or trauma-related), a significant psycho-social problem that may be overtly distracting to the operator (e.g. financial distress, relationship conflict or work-related stress), or use of a psychiatric medication (e.g. a benzodiazepine or neuroleptic) that may impair concentration.

**10.11** A CO must immediately suspend the EOD certification for an indefinite period if there is reliable evidence that an EOD operator has used a drug contrary to QR&O article 20.04, _Prohibition_.

11\. Reporting and Recording
----------------------------

### Requirement to Report

**11.1** A CO of an EOD unit must report, as soon as possible, through the chain of command, any EOD operation or tasking. The report must be made to the applicable operational or environmental HQ and the CFEOD.

**11.2** The procedures and format for a report set out in B-GJ-005-316/FP-001 must be followed.

**11.3** If the EOD operation or tasking has the potential to affect domestic operations or national security, CJOC must forward information to the Canadian Bomb Data Centre in the case of:

1.  an actual or attempted bombing;
2.  an IED; or
3.  recovery or disposal of a:
    1.  stolen or abandoned commercial detonator or explosive; or
    2.  home-made detonator or explosive.

### Channels of Communication

**11.4** In addition to normal reporting channels, direct liaison is authorized as set out in the following table:

| An ... | is authorized direct liaison on EOD technical matters with the ... |
| --- | --- |
| EOD unit
 | CFEOD, CJOC Joint Engineer EOD and the DtD CoE.

 |
| EOD unit or EOD operator

 | NATO EOD Technical Information Centre.

 |

### EOD Operator's Log

**11.5** All EOD operators must maintain an EOD operator's log in accordance with applicable instructions.

**11.6** Information in an EOD operator's log must be forwarded quarterly to the EOD operator's unit senior EOD operator and annually to the unit CO. The senior EOD operator must have an AJFA qualification and either an AEDV or AJFB qualification.

**11.7** The senior EOD operator must determine if an EOD operator is operationally ready  
(see paragraph 10.7) and must advise the unit CO. The CFEOD also confirms competency standards as part of an annual EOD inspection.

**11.8** Additional guidance, instructions and amendments in respect of an EOD operator's log may be provided in orders issued by the CFEOD on behalf of the Comd CA.
