3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** CANSOFCOM provides the CAF response to domestic and expeditionary counterterrorism. It also plays a critical role in the Government of Canada (GC) national security architecture as a high-readiness force of last resort to assist in protecting Canada and Canadians in the event of a terrorist incident beyond the scope of federal, provincial and municipal policing authorities.

**3.2** To accomplish its primary mission of counterterrorism, CANSOFCOM is tasked with the force development, force generation, force employment and sustainment of special operations task forces (SOTFs) and special operations forces (SOF) teams that are capable of achieving operational tasks on behalf of the GC and the CAF. SOTFs and SOF teams may support or conduct CAF expeditionary operations. CANSOFCOM operational tasks are described on the Special Operations Forces Web site.

**3.3** SOTFs and SOF teams rely on the element of surprise, speed and strict security relating to personnel, assets and operational tactics and plans in order to achieve operational tasks and safeguard personnel. This strict security includes the safeguarding of CANSOFCOM information and assets with controls that are based on the levels of potential injury due to unauthorized disclosure or access.

**3.4** CANSOFCOM information is any information that is unique to CANSOFCOM, including any information consisting of or relating to any of the following:

1.  identities of personnel employed in a CANSOFCOM unit, SOTF or SOF team;
2.  individual roles and positions of personnel employed in CANSOFCOM;
3.  assigned number of personnel, establishment, organizational strength, unit strength and order of battle of a CANSOFCOM unit, SOTF or SOF team;
4.  CANSOFCOM command, control, communications and computers;
5.  CANSOFCOM unique assets;
6.  CANSOFCOM tactics, techniques and procedures;
7.  movement of CANSOFCOM personnel and assets;
8.  mission, location, scope, duration and other related details associated with operations, exercises and other activities of CANSOFCOM personnel;
9.  capabilities, limitations and vulnerabilities of CANSOFCOM personnel, assets, units, SOTFs and SOF teams; and
10.  SOF unique training, courses and qualifications, including training provided by foreign military or private organizations to CANSOFCOM.

**3.5** Security categories (classifications and protections) and markings are determined by the Comd CANSOFCOM or designated officials to ensure confidentiality and mitigate the risk of injury to national and non-national interests. These determinations are made available to DND employees and CAF members in order to limit the potential injury to national security and personnel conducting missions and to ensure operational success. CANSOFCOM also applies operations security.

### Policy Statement

**3.6** The DND and the CAF are committed to ensuring the safety and security of CANSOFCOM personnel, operations, exercises and other activities through the management and safeguarding of CANSOFCOM information and assets by all DND employees, CAF members and contractors.

### Requirements

**3.7** The DND and CAF must:

1.  establish procedures to identify, manage and safeguard CANSOFCOM information and assets;
2.  provide public affairs guidance on the disclosure of CANSOFCOM information;
3.  identify the appropriate security categories and markings required for CANSOFCOM information and assets; and
4.  inform DND, CAF and other GC personnel and organizations of approved security category and marking decisions specific to CANSOFCOM.

Consequences of non-compliance may include one or more of the following:

1.  the ordering of the completion of appropriate learning, training or professional development;
2.  increased reporting and performance monitoring;
3.  the withdrawal of any authority provided under this DAOD to a DND employee or CAF member;
