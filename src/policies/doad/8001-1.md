3\. Overview
------------

### General

**3.1** The _National Defence Security Orders and Directives_ (NDSODs) require the safeguarding of the confidentiality of government information within the DND and the CAF. Information relating to the force development, force generation and force employment of special operations task forces (SOTFs) and special operations forces (SOF) teams is information that requires confidentiality to achieve operational tasks. The failure to provide confidentiality is detrimental to national security, the success of SOTFs and SOF teams in achieving operational tasks, and the safety of personnel.

**3.2** The CAF conducts operations combining SOF with conventional forces and continues to expand the use of SOF. As a consequence, increasing numbers of DND employees and CAF members require access to CANSOFCOM information and assets to perform assigned duties. Day-to-day operations require information security of CANSOFCOM information. Any failure to achieve information security of CANSOFCOM information may increase the risk to the Government of Canada (GC), DND, CAF and individuals.

**Note** – CANSOFCOM information is described in detail in paragraph 3.4 of [DAOD 8001-0](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/8000-series/8001/8001-0-canadian-special-operations-forces-command-information-asset-security.html), _Canadian Special Operations Forces Command – Information and Asset Security_.

4\. Security Categories and Markings
------------------------------------

### General

**4.1** Only the Comd CANSOFCOM or a designated official may:

1.  determine the security categories (classifications and protections) of CANSOFCOM information and assets;
2.  determine additional security markings that identify access, distribution, use and reproduction restrictions respecting CANSOFCOM information and assets;
3.  provide access to security categorization guides developed by CANSOFCOM to permit derivative marking by the DND and the CAF; and
4.  resolve challenges to security categories and marking decisions.

**4.2** Any information or asset that is subject to a challenge of the security category or marking decision of the Comd CANSOFCOM or a designated official must retain the original security category or marking until the challenge is resolved and the results are implemented.

**4.3** There is a right of access which applies to any record under the control of the DND or the CAF unless the record qualifies for an exemption or is specifically excluded from the application of the _Access to Information Act_ or the _Privacy Act_. All decisions that any CANSOFCOM information requires a security category or marking must relate directly to the exemption and exclusion criteria found in the _Access to Information Act_ and the _Privacy Act_.

5\. Management of Information and Assets
----------------------------------------

### General

**5.1** A DND employee or CAF member who is responsible for CANSOFCOM information and assets must ensure that the information and assets are:

1.  properly controlled at all times within the DND and the CAF;
2.  subject to explicit and unambiguous requirements for access under the need-to-know principle;
3.  disclosed, in the case of information, if necessary to satisfy a legal requirement under the _Access to Information Act_, _Privacy Act_, _Canada Evidence Act_, _Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act_ or other legislation; and
4.  disclosed, in the case of information or assets, to other GC employees, CAF members or foreign governments only when authorized by the Comd CANSOFCOM or a designated official.

**5.2** Unless information is disclosed in accordance with a legal requirement (see subparagraph 5.1.c), a DND employee or CAF member who is authorized to disclose CANSOFCOM information must ensure that any recipient:

1.  possesses the requisite security clearance or reliability status;
2.  has satisfied the need-to-know principle;
3.  has been authorized by the Comd CANSOFCOM or a designated official to access, process or possess the information; and
4.  has been briefed on applicable markings.

**Note** – Approval by other applicable DND and CAF authorities may also be required if the CANSOFCOM information contains information subject to other restrictions, for example intelligence or controlled goods.

**5.3** For purposes of [DAOD 1001-1](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1001/1001-1-access-to-information-act-requests.html), _Formal Requests for Access to Departmental Information_, and DAOD [1001-2](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/policies-standards/defence-administrative-orders-directives/1000-series/1001/1001-2-informal-requests-access-departmental-information.html), _Informal Requests for Access to Departmental Information_, CANSOFCOM is an office of primary interest that must be consulted prior to the disclosure of any records that contain CANSOFCOM information.

### Public Affairs (PA)

**5.4** All PA activities that include or are related to CANSOFCOM information must be coordinated with the CANSOFCOM PA officer, who will coordinate these activities with the Assistant Deputy Minister (PA) and applicable staff in accordance with the DAOD 2008 series and relevant communications plans.

**5.5** The Comd CANSOFCOM or a designated official may grant approval to a DND employee or CAF member to disclose:

1.  CANSOFCOM information to the media; and
2.  the identity or image of any CANSOFCOM DND employee, CAF member, contractor or advisor.

**5.6** All public requests for CANSOFCOM information, other than a request based on a legal requirement mentioned in subparagraph 5.1.c, must be directed to the CANSOFCOM PA officer. This includes requests for:

1.  disclosure of CANSOFCOM information to the media; and
2.  permission of a DND employee and CAF member to speak to the media relating to CANSOFCOM information or assets.

### Unauthorized Disclosure

**5.7** Any unauthorized disclosure of CANSOFCOM information contravenes the PGS, _Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector_, the NDSI and NDSP. Unauthorized disclosure may also constitute an offence under the _Security of Information Act_ and the _National Defence Act_.

**5.8** A DND employee or CAF member must report any actual or suspected unauthorized disclosure of CANSOFCOM information to their supervisor or unit security officer.

### Security Categorization and Markings

**5.9** DND employees and CAF members must apply:

1.  the authorized security categorization and markings to all CANSOFCOM information and assets; and
2.  the security category “unclassified” in the case of unclassified CANSOFCOM information or assets.

### Electronic Storage, Processing and Transmission

**5.10** DND employees and CAF members must ensure that CANSOFCOM information is stored, processed and transmitted only on authorized GC, DND or CAF information technology systems or communications devices that have been approved for the highest security category or the most restrictive marking of the information. CANSOFCOM information may also be stored, processed and transmitted on authorized GC, DND or CAF information technology systems or communications devices that have been approved at a higher security category or more restrictive marking.

### Handling of CANSOFCOM Records

**5.11** DND employees and CAF members must ensure that all CANSOFCOM records are handled in accordance with the Defence Subject Classification and Disposition System.

### Casualty and Repatriation Information

**5.12** DND employees and CAF members must ensure that casualty information resulting from CANSOFCOM operations, exercises or other activities are not disclosed without prior CANSOFCOM authorization. Detailed direction on the administration of casualties and the repatriation of CANSOFCOM personnel is available from CANSOFCOM J1.

### Honours and Awards

**5.13** The circumstances surrounding the submission of honours or awards relating to CANSOFCOM activities, including those for DND employees and CAF members temporarily attached or employed with CANSOFCOM, require special procedures to safeguard operational and personal information. CANSOFCOM must be consulted when a DND employee or CAF member is nominated for an honour or award relating to CANSOFCOM employment or service.

### Approval of Visits

**5.14** Only the Comd CANSOFCOM or a designated official may authorize visits to any domestic or foreign CANSOFCOM facility, unit, site or activity. All visits must be planned and conducted in accordance with:

1.  the DAOD 2001 series;
2.  CFAO 20-5, _Temporary Duty – DND Personnel_; and
3.  NDSI 44, _Visits to and from DND_.

### Contracting

**5.15** In addition to the specific guidance on contracting in the _Defence Security Manual_, Chapter 2, _Contracts and the Security Requirements Checklist_, any contract that provides for access, storage or use of CANSOFCOM information or assets must include binding provisions that identify additional security measures for the information or assets. Any contract that will provide access to CANSOFCOM information or assets must also include a security categorization guide for the CANSOFCOM information or assets.

**5.16** Only the Comd CANSOFCOM or a designated official may approve the disclosure of CANSOFCOM information by a contractor, including disclosure by a contractor to a sub-contractor.
