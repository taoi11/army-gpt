4\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**4.1** Canadian CBRND policies and procedures have been developed since 1945 in conjunction with:

1.  our allies, through standardization agreements with NATO;
2.  American, Australian, British and Canadian standardization programs; and
3.  co-operative development programs with the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

**4.2** CBRND is a highly specialized enabling capability of FP that requires staff with a full understanding of all technical aspects of the deployment and subsequent employment of the CBRND capability in support of CAF operations. A force not enabled with a basic CBRN FP capability unnecessarily risks the possibility of significant casualties and mission failure. The publication A-FD-005-005/AF-003, _Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Operating Concept_, stresses that CBRND capability can be critical to the success of a CAF domestic or expeditionary operation when a CBRN threat exists. This publication provides:

1.  a framework to establish an effective CBRN FP capability with requisite capacity to achieve objectives outlined in the Canada First Defence Strategy; and
2.  the basis for the development of future CBRN capabilities and contingency plans.

**4.3** The first line of defence against CBRN weapons lies in preventing the proliferation of such weapons. To prevent their proliferation, the DND and the CAF participate in and support verification activities under existing international arms control agreements as well as the development of future agreements and export control regimes. If the proliferation of a specific type of CBRN weapon occurs, the DND and CAF would work to reverse it through diplomatic means.

**4.4** The policy of Canada with respect to CBRN weapons and CBRN agents takes into consideration the obligations of Canada under international law, including the following arms control agreements:

1.  the 1968 _Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons_, under which Canada agreed not to transfer or transfer control over, either directly or indirectly, or assist, any non-nuclear state to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and not to receive the transfer of or manufacture, receive assistance in manufacturing or to otherwise acquire, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices;
2.  the 1972 _Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction_, under which Canada agreed never to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain biological agents or toxins for other than protective or peaceful purposes, or weapons, equipment or means of delivery to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict; and
3.  the 1993 _Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction_, under which Canada undertook never to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain, use or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons or engage in any military preparations to use such weapons. Those obligations were formally integrated into Canadian domestic law with the _Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act_.

**4.5** As CBRN weapons exist throughout the world and no verification regime can guarantee their absence, there is a continuing requirement to ensure the protection of the DND and the CAF against such weapons. To this end, small quantities of certain biological and chemical agents are held for defensive purposes under the provisions of treaties and conventions. These agents are never used in experiments on human subjects but may be used in:

1.  R&D facilities to test and develop CBRND capabilities; and
2.  training establishments to instil confidence in CAF members in their use of protective equipment and procedures.

**4.6** Certification that R&D projects comply with this DAOD is reported annually in accordance with the provisions of ADM(Mat) Instruction 8/89, _Approval and Certification of the Research and Development Chemical/Biological Defence Program_.

**4.7** Under the provisions of the _Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction_, Canada has renounced the right to use RCAs as a method of warfare, but reserves the right to use RCAs for law enforcement, including domestic riot control. As such, training with and defensive use of certain RCAs may be authorized for designated DND employees and CAF members involved in domestic operations in support of Canadian law enforcement authorities or on international operations not involving the use of an RCA as a method of warfare against belligerents within an armed conflict.

**4.8** The DND and the CAF are excluded from the application of the _Nuclear Safety and Control Act_ and its regulations in respect to any military operation and military equipment, except in respect to any activity taking place at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. D N Safe is responsible, under DAOD 4002-0, _Nuclear Technology Regulation and Control_, and DAOD 4002-1, _Nuclear and Ionizing Radiation Safety_, for the regulatory oversight of all matters related to DND and CAF nuclear activities.

**4.9** The BCDRC is a federally-mandated civilian committee that reports directly to the MND and confirms annually that biological and chemical agents are not being used to develop an offensive biological or chemical warfare capability.

**4.10** The CAF maintains an immediate and effective response to the threatened use or use of CBRN agents by adversaries. DND employees may be involved in CAF operations when they are considered essential for such operations. Accordingly, both DND employees and CAF members involved in operations are required to be able to operate effectively in a CBRN environment.

**Policy Statement**

**4.11** It is the policy of the DND and the CAF to:

1.  never develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain biological or chemical agents or toxins other than in quantities permitted under treaties or conventions to which Canada is a party and that are necessary for defensive research, training or other peaceful purposes;
2.  never receive the transfer of or control over, either directly or indirectly, manufacture, or receive assistance in manufacturing, or otherwise acquire, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices;
3.  never use, or participate in planning to use, chemical, biological or toxin weapons;
4.  continue to maintain the obligations of Canada as a founding member of NATO with respect to nuclear consultation and planning;
5.  authorize the use by CAF members of RCA, under rules of engagement authorized by the CDS, in domestic operations in support of Canadian law enforcement authorities or international operations not involving the use of an RCA as a method of warfare against belligerents within an armed conflict;
6.  permit the use of an RCA by members of the military police under CAF Provost Marshal policies;
7.  ensure DND employees and CAF members involved in domestic or international operations carry out their functions in a CBRN environment with minimum disruption to the tempo of the operation and without significant casualties;
8.  not impose on DND employees or CAF members more risk than is necessary to achieve the aim of any operation, mission or task which may involve CBRN hazards; and
9.  take all reasonable measures to minimize the exposure of DND employees and CAF members to CBRN hazards as reasonably achievable, taking into consideration relevant operational, social and economic factors.

**Requirements**

**4.12** To implement this policy, the DND and the CAF must:

1.  integrate CBRND fundamentals into the decision-making process for policy, capability development, program design, R&D, service delivery, and military doctrine and operations;
2.  articulate and communicate responsibilities for CBRND across all levels of the DND and the CAF to ensure the CBRND roles and responsibilities of all DND employees and CAF members are clearly defined and understood;
3.  provide DND employees involved in operations and CAF members with the doctrine, procedures, training and equipment to conduct and support operations and survive and function in a CBRN environment;
4.  ensure, if possible and practicable, that CBRND doctrine, procedures, plans, training and equipment are interoperable with the capabilities of Canadian civil authorities and allies;
5.  establish DND and CAF plans and procedures for the proactive management of issues and crises involving a CBRN weapon or CBRN agent in domestic or international operations, or a nuclear emergency under the _Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan_;
6.  integrate, to the maximum extent practicable, domestic CBRND with civil arrangements through protocols, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements with other federal and provincial government departments and civil authorities to assist with incidents involving a CBRN weapon, CBRN agent or nuclear emergency;
7.  consider integrating CBRN hardening criteria into operation-, mission- or task-essential equipment;
8.  incorporate CBRND into all applicable training – individual and collective training, basic and pre-operational deployment training, and DND management and CAF leadership training;
9.  establish requirements, procedures, standards of proficiency, evaluation criteria, training and education for CBRND in a manner that is cost effective and consistent with DND and CAF strategic direction and ratified NATO standards;
10.  co-operate in annual BCDRC reviews of DND and CAF CBRND activities;
11.  establish and maintain capabilities to manage initial reconnaissance, site survey, sampling, testing and analysis of potential environmental and industrial health hazards and CBRN environments to identify appropriate FP measures and areas requiring special precautions consistent with the analysis;
12.  establish and maintain military escort teams to support the SJS ACV missions; and
13.  ensure in respect of radiological and nuclear defence that CBRND programs are compliant with the international obligations and domestic laws of Canada, and the DAOD 4002 series.

5\. Consequences
----------------

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**

**5.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.

**5.2** Non-compliance with this DOAD may also constitute a breach of domestic and international legal obligations, which could result in DND management or CAF command responsibility, and personal liability.
