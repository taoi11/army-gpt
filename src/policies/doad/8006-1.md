4\. Operations
--------------

**General**

**4.1** CBRND is divided into the following five doctrinal enabling components as set out in B-GL-005-380/FP-101, CFJP 3-8.1, _Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Operations_:

1.  detection, identification and monitoring;
2.  information management;
3.  physical protection;
4.  hazard management; and
5.  med CMs and support.

**4.2** CBRND staffs must form part of the operations staff of all HQ, formations, units and other elements.

**CBRND Support to Operations**

**4.3** The comds of operational commands, i.e. Comd CJOC and Comd CANSOFCOM, must ensure operational plans include CBRND support to operations and must advise senior management and government officials on CBRND matters.

**4.4** CBRND support consists of IS, CS and GS.

**CBRND IS**

**4.5** CBRND IS resources are limited in scope. Unit COs and officers commanding sub-units must ensure they have sufficient CBRND IS resources to survive and maintain operational tempo while awaiting CBRND CS or GS resources. The commitment of CBRND IS resources is planned and executed at the lowest possible tactical level. CBRND IS consists of functions that enable a unit or sub-unit to:

1.  survive in a CBRN environment; and
2.  maintain its operational tempo.

**CBRND CS**

**4.6** CBRND CS consists of functions that enable a formation or unit to maintain or restore operational tempo within a short period of time, but which are beyond the CBRND IS capability of a unit. The commitment of CBRN CS resources is normally planned and executed at the tactical level.

**CBRND GS**

**4.7** CBRND GS consists of functions beyond CBRND CS or CBRND IS capabilities. CBRND GS is carried out by specialist CBRND elements. The commitment of CBRND GS resources is planned at the operational level but executed at the tactical level.

**Intelligence**

**4.8** The CDI conducts intelligence assessments of CBRN threats involving:

1.  chemical, biological and radiological agents;
2.  toxic industrial materials; and
3.  terrorism.

**CBRND Operations**

**4.9** The CBRND doctrine for the CAF reflects the international strategic situation and the wide variety of roles and tasks that the CAF may encounter in an operational environment. The documentation of CBRND doctrine has been organized in the following publications:

1.  A-FD-005-005/AF-003, _Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Operating Concept_;
2.  B-GJ-005-311/FP-020, _Canadian Forces Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Tactics,Techniques and Procedures_, outlines the operational procedures necessary to operate CBRND equipment for the effective conduct of all CBRND operations of the CAF;
3.  B-GJ-005-311/FP-021, _Canadian Forces Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Tactics, Techniques and Procedures – Urban_, sets out tactics and operational procedures required to conduct CBRND operations in urban areas;
4.  B-GJ-005-311/FP-030, _Canadian Forces Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Aide-Mémoire,_ provides a summary of CBRND doctrine and procedures;
5.  B-GJ-005-311/FP-040, _Canadian Forces Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Equipment_, details the operating instructions, safety considerations and capabilities and limitations of CBRND equipment in service in the CAF;
6.  B-GL-005-380/FP-001, CFJP 3-8, _Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence_, introduces the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence doctrine at the strategic and operational levels and details the organization for CBRND in the CAF, based on the current threat environment and approved joint doctrine; and
7.  B-GL-005-380/FP-101, is a supporting publication to B-GL-005-380/FP-001. This publication guides CBRND staff in advising comds on the production of CBRND plans and the conduct of CBRND operations, and is the principal reference for training, standardization and evaluation in CBRND.

**Domestic Operations**

**4.10** Domestic operations are conducted in accordance with B-GJ-005-302/FP-001, CFJP 3-2, _Domestic Operations_ and CJOC _Standing Operation Order for Domestic Operations (SOODO)_.

**International Operations**

**4.11** International operations are conducted in accordance with the CDIO.

**Evaluation**

**4.12** In general, CBRND readiness must be evaluated by the DOS SJS to ensure that units are adequately prepared to operate in a CBRN environment. Both the proficiency of forces to operate in a CBRN environment and the capability of CBRND must be evaluated as set out below.

**Proficiency**

**4.13** The proficiency of forces to conduct operations in a CBRN environment must be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure forces are prepared, thus minimizing refresher training required prior to operations. The standards and evaluation criteria are provided in Chapter 9 of B-GL-005-380/FP-101.

**Capability**

**4.14** The primary capability manager for CBRND in the CAF is D JCBRN D. The CBRND capability development program is explained in detail in section 7. CBRND capability, including policy, doctrine, plans, procedures, training and equipment, must be evaluated by the D JCBRN D during the planning and conduct of operations and training to ensure that it:

1.  provides the necessary ability for forces to conduct operations in a CBRN environment with little or no effect on their operational tempo; and
2.  is compliant with all international obligations and domestic laws of Canada, and DND and CAF policies and instructions.

**Controlled Material and Equipment – CBRND Equipment**

**4.15** CBRN defence equipment requirements vary from one operation to another, requiring scales of issue to be tailored. For each operation, the CJOC develops scales of issue. CANSOFCOM maintains its own capability to develop scales of issue for SOF. The DOS SJS, in consultation with D JCBRN D and in response to the operational commands, affects the release of the necessary CBRN defence equipment from operational stocks.

**CBRN Med CMs**

**4.16** Each SPI is operation-specific. The most commonly recommended SPI consists of three HI-6/atropine auto-injectors, one diazepam auto-injector, two Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion pouches, as well as a seven-day supply of pyridostigmine bromide or a supply of antibiotics, for each CAF member. CBRN medical treatment kits are issued to medical elements based on the CBRN threat. These contain a variety of drugs for administration only by qualified medical personnel. The CBRN med CMs reserve stocks are specified for each operation in the tasking order. Specific instructions regarding CBRN med CMs for CAF operations is provided in section 5.

**Ionizing Radiation Exposure**

**4.17** Exposures to ionizing radiation, both external (radiation source outside the body) and internal (radiation source within the body), account for the dose incurred by an individual. Ionizing radiation exposure in all operations is managed to the lowest levels reasonably achievable, taking into consideration social, economic and military operational factors, along with the exposure limits and requirements set out in the NSODs. Any ionizing radiation doses received during operations that are above background levels are considered “occupational doses” and must be reported to the NDR. Authorization requirements for increases in the levels of exposure to ionizing radiation are also set out in NSODs. The advice of the D N Safe should be sought when setting an upper dose limit and when contemplating increasing that limit.

**Interoperability – Standardization**

**4.18** The CAF is required to be capable of operating with allied forces in a CBRN environment, as well as with other GC departments and agencies. CBRND interoperability is achieved by:

1.  active participation in inter-departmental and international forums;
2.  protocols, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements;
3.  the development, ratification and implementation of standardized policies, doctrine, procedures and protocols;
4.  participation in national and international training and exercises; and
5.  operation of the CBR MOU (see paragraphs 7.17 and 7.18 for more details).

**NATO JCBRND-CDG**

**4.19** The mission of the NATO JCBRND-CDG is to provide NATO with the CBRND operational and technical standards necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts of an intentional or inadvertent CBRN release on NATO forces. The D JCBRN D leads the Canadian delegation to JCBRND-CDG meetings, acts as the Canadian POC for issues arising from the JCBRND-CDG meetings and represents Canada in subordinate panels of the JCBRND-CDG as required. Other DND and CAF organizations, such as ADM(S&T), represent Canada in subordinate panels of the JCBRND-CDG as appropriate.

**NATO CBRN Med WG**

**4.20** The NATO CBRN Med WG is an organization subordinate to the NATO Committee of the Chiefs of Military Medical Services, also known as the “CoMedS”. This WG prepares doctrine and procedures for defence against radiation (ionizing and non-ionizing), biological, chemical and laser directed energy weapons, or CBRN or laser hazards that result directly or indirectly from military operations. The Surg Gen appoints an officer to represent Canada at NATO CBRN Med WG meetings, who then acts as the Canadian POC for issues arising from the NATO CBRN Med WG.

**AUSCANNZUKUS CBRND Interoperability**

**4.21** CBRND interoperability of AUSCANNZUKUS forces is achieved through the implementation of AUSCANNZUKUS naval standardization agreements, ABCA Program standards, and Air and Space Interoperability Council air standards. When two or more of the CAF environments adopt doctrine, equipment, tactics, techniques or procedures developed under these programs, it should be incorporated into CAF joint doctrine. Another key interoperability mechanism is the CBR MOU which concerns the research, development and acquisition of CBRN materiel.

5\. Medical Countermeasures for CAF Operations
----------------------------------------------

**Purpose**

**5.1** The purpose of this section is to identify the requirements related to the distribution, storage, use and disposal of CBRN med CMs. The instructions in this section apply to all CAF operations (domestic and expeditionary), as well as any pre-deployment training and preparations, and DND support to CAF operations.

**Mandatory CBRN Med CMs**

**5.2** Mandatory CBRN med CMs must be identified in each tasking order on an operation-specific basis. The pre-positioning of CBRN med CMs is an FP requirement. However, CBRN med CMS are distributed and used only when ordered. For the purposes of this paragraph, “use” is self-administration, buddy-administration or administration by a healthcare professional.

**Authority to Order the Use of CBRN Pre-Treatments and Pre-Exposure Vaccinations, and Individually-Issued CBRN Med CMs**

**5.3** Under DAOD 8006-0, _Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence_, only the CDS has the authority to order the use of CBRN pre-treatments and pre-exposure vaccinations, and individually-issued CBRN med CMs (with the exception of radioiodine uptake preventative med CMs (see paragraph 5.5)). The CDS has delegated the authority to order the use of CBRN pre-treatments and individually-issued CBRN med CMs to comds of operational commands (see the _Authority Table_ in DAOD 8006-0). Authority to order the use of mandatory CBRN pre-exposure vaccinations is not delegated. An order to use CBRN med CMs constitutes the authority to distribute and issue CBRN med CMs.

**Use of CBRN Pre-Treatments and Pre-Exposure Vaccinations, and Individually-Issued CBRN Med CMs**

**5.4** The use of CBRN pre-treatments and pre-exposure vaccinations, and individually-issued CBRN med CMs, may be requested by the senior CAF comd, regional joint task force comd or task force comd through the comd of the responsible operational command. Under DAOD 8006-0, in case of an operational emergency, when a delay in seeking operational command authority to order the use of CBRN pre-treatments and individually-issued CBRN med CMs may result in unacceptable risk to CAF members, the senior CAF comd is authorized to order the use of CBRN pre-treatments or individually-issued CBRN med CMs. The senior CAF comd must notify the comd of the respective operational command of the action taken as soon as practicable.

**Radioiodine Uptake Preventative Med CMs**

**5.5** Radioiodine uptake preventative med CMs may be offered, but not ordered. Under DAOD 8006-0, the authority to offer radioiodine uptake preventative med CMs is delegated to the respective RCN nuclear emergency comds (i.e. base comds of CFB Halifax and CFB Esquimalt, and CO Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges).

**Pre-Positioning of CBRN Med CMs**

**5.6** In consultation with the Comd CJOC or Comd CANSOFCOM, the Surg Gen is authorized under DAOD 8006-0 to pre- position (for individuals or groups, in accordance with operational requirements) all CBRN med CMs within and outside of CF H Svcs Gp control. Comds of operational commands may determine in-theatre locations of pre-positioned stocks. However, storage conditions and medical oversight must meet requirements of both the manufacturer of the CBRN med CMs in question and as set out in CF H Svcs Gp Instruction 4200-01, _Accounting, Reporting and Handling Requirements for Surgeon General Restricted Products._

**Licensed and Unlicensed CBRN Med CMs**

**5.7** CBRN med CMs include both licensed and unlicensed medical products under the _Food and Drugs Act_ and its regulations. Many CBRN med CMs require an additional level of control and are therefore designated as “SG restricted products”. The use of these medical products, including unlicensed medical products, has been deemed essential for FP. As a result, Health Canada has granted the CAF access to these unlicensed medical products on the condition of strict compliance with the terms and conditions of the SAP. The accounting, reporting and handling of SG restricted products must be in compliance with CF H Svcs Gp Instruction 4200-01, which is based on the regulations pertaining to the SAP in the _Food and Drug Regulations_. The requirements of CF H Svcs Gp Instruction 4200-01 are applicable in all cases when there are plans for the use of SG restricted products or when they are issued or used. These requirements include:

1.  control by a CF H Svcs Gp pharmacist (military or civilian), who is responsible for all aspects of CBRN med CMs handling;
2.  control by the physician at units without a pharmacist;
3.  control by the CO at units without a pharmacist or physician;
4.  the application of narcotic accounting procedures to SG restricted products, including maintaining a detailed register of all receipts, issues, use, loss, wastage, destruction and any adverse events; and
5.  the submission of reports in accordance with paragraphs 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53 and 54, and subparagraph 48b of CF H Svcs Gp Instruction 4200-01.

**Briefing and Training**

**5.8** When CBRN med CMs are either pre-positioned at a unit whose members are to be deployed, used by CAF members prior to deployment or carried by CAF members being deployed into an area of operation, the parent unit CO and the senior physician at that unit, base or wing are responsible to ensure, in accordance with CF H Svcs Gp Instruction 4200-01, that:

1.  the CAF members are trained in the use of applicable individually-issued CBRN med CMs, including immediate action drills; and
2.  for CBRN pre-treatments and pre-exposure vaccinations, and individually-issued CBRN med CMs (except radioiodine uptake preventative med CMs), the appropriate briefing is delivered to and acknowledgement forms are signed by all CAF members either prior to their deployment or, in the case of designated units, as part of their unit training.

**Deployment and Redeployment**

**5.9** During a deployment, the in-theatre CO and supporting physician are responsible for monitoring CAF members and reporting all adverse events relating to CBRN med CMs. When the CAF members have been redeployed back to their parent unit, the parent unit CO and the senior physician at that unit, base or wing must ensure that the CAF members are monitored and all adverse events relating to CBRN med CMs are reported.

**5.10** Vaccine doses are administered either during the pre-deployment or the deployment phase of an operation according to the approved schedule. No further doses are administered after redeployment outside the threat area, without the approval of the Director Health Services Operations as based on the assessed medical requirement.

**5.11** CAF members are required to comply with allied forces CBRN med CM directives only if these have been reviewed and approved by the CAF Surg Gen or a physician designated by the Surg Gen. When practicable, vaccinations are administered by the CF H Svcs Gp before the CAF members join the allied force.

**5.12** Allied personnel may not accompany CAF units or elements on operations unless their parent force certifies its acceptance of CAF CBRN med CM directives.

**5.13** Requirements for the provision of CBRN med CMs for military visitors to CAF operations are addressed on a case-by-case basis.

**5.14** CBRN med CMs are intended for CAF members only. The circumstances under which CBRN med CMs can be provided to civilians, including DND employees and civilian visitors to CAF operations, must be prescribed by the Minister of National Defence (see paragraph 6.2 in DAOD 80096-0).

6.Training
----------

**General**

**6.1** The response of personnel exposed to CBRN agents should be automatic. Accordingly:

1.  applicable DND employees and all CAF members must be trained in basic CBRND survival skills; and
2.  all comds and COs must:  
    i. understand the implications of conducting operations in a CBRN environment;  
    ii. ensure their personnel are trained in basic CBRND survival skills; andiii. be trained themselves to  
    plan and conduct CBRND operations.

**6.2** The training requirements in paragraphs 6.3 to 6.18 are in addition to the general requirements in paragraph 6.1.

**Individual Training**

**6.3** The comds of the RCN, CA and RCAF must ensure that appropriate CBRND training is provided for CAF members in their commands and that such training is conducted in accordance with DAOD 5031-2, _Individual Training and Education Strategic Framework_.

**Collective Training**

**6.4** A CO must include CBRND in collective training at the unit level to ensure that all elements of the unit can work together effectively in a CBRN environment.

**6.5** A formation comd must include CBRND in collective training at the formation level to ensure all units and other elements of the formation can work together effectively in a CBRN environment.

**Contract Personnel**

**6.6** A CO must ensure that appropriate CBRND training is provided to contract personnel as specified in their contract.

**Live Chemical Agent Training**

**6.7** CAF members who act as CBRND specialists should be confident that military operations can be conducted safely in a CBRN-contaminated environment. To ensure this confidence, live chemical agent training should be conducted in a realistic but controlled environment. Realism will enhance the opportunities for CAF members to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of their equipment, and the reliability of CBRND techniques, as well as validate their competence.

**6.8** Live chemical agent training in Canada is only conducted at the DRDC Suffield Counter Terrorism and Technology Centre, which has the unique expertise and facilities required for such training.

**6.9** Live chemical agent training is authorized for the following groups in the following order of priority:

1.  the CJIRU-CBRN;
2.  CBRND GS units, including decontamination units;
3.  the Advanced CBRN Defence Officer Course;
4.  the Land Force Technical Staff Program;
5.  CAF fleet schools, unit CBRND officers and unit CBRND instructors;
6.  the DRDC Suffield Decontamination Team;
7.  designated units, sub-units and detachments as necessary in preparation for operations;
8.  allied forces; and
9.  civilian first-responders.

**6.10** Requests for DND employees and CAF members, other than those referred to in paragraph 6.9, to participate in live chemical agent training, including as observers, must be forwarded to D CBRN D for Comd CA approval.

**6.11** The CEO DRDC Suffield may contract with organizations outside of the DND and the CAF to conduct live chemical agent training without CFD approval, but this must not interfere with scheduled DND and CAF training. Any live chemical agent training contract must only be undertaken in accordance with international treaty obligations, and domestic statutory and regulatory requirements.

**Use of Ionizing Radiation Sources in Radiological and Nuclear Defence Training**

**6.12** In order to provide realism in radiological and nuclear defence training, unsealed and sealed ionizing radioactive sources are used.

**6.13** The primary goal of radiological and nuclear defence training using unsealed or sealed ionizing radiation sources is to provide basic instruction on the detection, proper handling and mitigation of radioactive material. Other goals include providing experience in the use of detection and sampling equipment, learning to apply radiation protection principles and learning how to work safely in contaminated environments. In addition to standard radiation safety training, special attention is paid to contamination control and the detection of radioisotopes. This type of practical radiation exercise gives participants the opportunity to put theory into practice.

**6.14** D N Safe authorization is required under the NSODs to conduct radiological or nuclear defence training. Early collaboration with D N Safe staff is essential for timely approval of radiological or nuclear defence training requests. D N Safe collaboration on radiological or nuclear-related training standards is also required.

**RCA Use in Training**

**6.15** To afford realism, CS gas is authorized for use in training. No other RCA is authorized for use in training. Procedures and limitations on the use of CS gas are set out in B-GJ-005-311/FP-020.

**6.16** Training with CS gas is designed to teach DND employees and CAF members how to react correctly to a chemical warfare attack and use individual and collective protective equipment properly. CS gas can cause intense irritation and, although normally non-lethal, can result in significant short-term or long-term illness and, in extreme cases, death. Accordingly, only those personnel who have been properly briefed on the risks and fully trained on chemical defence measures and how to use chemical defence equipment may be subjected to training with CS gas.

**6.17** CS gas and all other RCAs must not be used to conduct “rites of passage” or other similar activities. Any unauthorized activity with CS gas or any other RCA is prohibited and may:

1.  constitute a criminal offence; and
2.  result in administrative or disciplinary action, or both.

**6.18** It is prohibited for any DND employee or CAF member to use an RCA as a weapon in an armed conflict.

**Training Standards and Validation**

**6.19** D JCBRN D, in cooperation with MES authorities as set out in DAOD 5070-0, _Military Employment Structure_, must develop joint CBRND training standards based on ratified NATO proficiency standards, and general and occupation specialty qualifications. CBRND proficiency standards are set out in B-GL-005-380/FP-101.

**6.20** For CBRND procedures for specialized CBRND units, the D JCBRN D is responsible for assisting in the development of unique operational standards on which training is based.

**6.21** For CBRND procedures unique to each environment, the D JCBRN D may assist in developing unique operational standards on which training is based.

**Monitoring CBRND Individual Training**

**6.22** The D JCBRN D and a representative of the Comd CFSTG act as the co-chairs of the CBRN Defence Training Steering Committee. The Committee is constituted of representatives from the environmental and joint staffs, and occupation managing authorities. The Committee meets when jointly agreed by the co-chairs to review CBRND training issues.

**NATO CBRND TEP Participation**

**6.23** The NATO CBRND TEP of the JCBRND-CDG develops NATO CBRND training procedures in accordance with STANAGs. The D JCBRN D leads the Canadian delegation to CBRND TEP meetings and acts as the Canadian POC for issues arising from CBRND TEP meetings. Subject to NATO attendee limitations, representatives of the ECSs, the Comd CF H Svcs Gp and the CO CFFCA may attend CBRND TEP meetings as members of the Canadian delegation.

7\. Capability Development and Sustainment
------------------------------------------

**General**

**7.1** The delivery of CBRND capability is based on:

1.  the five doctrinal enabling components referred to in paragraph 4.1;
2.  R&D, when new capability is to be developed;
3.  life cycle support of equipment, supplies and services;
4.  concepts, doctrine and tactics, techniques and procedures documents;
5.  formal training through the CFFCA and regular unit training;
6.  FSE;
7.  capability-based planning;
8.  the FCG;
9.  the _Canada First_ Defence Strategy;
10.  information technology and support infrastructure; and
11.  personnel.

**Identifying** **Operational Capability Requirements and Deficiencies**

**7.2** The primary capability developer and manager for CBRND in the CAF is the D JCBRN D. It is essential that CBRND capabilities meet operational requirements based on capability development requirements determined initially by the D JCBRN D working with the personnel of the SJS, CJOC and CANSOFCOM, and then developed in detail in consultation with the ECSs. The DOS SJS must ensure the D JCBRN D is kept informed of operational CBRN issues and incidents to ensure the required CBRND capabilities are identified. Operational comds and ECSs must understand existing CBRND capabilities and report deficiencies though the chain of command to the DOS SJS. The D JCBRN D must be informed of all readiness reports, technical failure reports and unsatisfactory condition reports that identify CBRND deficiencies.

**Capability Development Process**

**7.3** The Comd CA is responsible for CAF joint CBRND capabilities. As such, CFD is the sponsor for all joint CBRND projects and is represented by a project leader (sponsor), normally a director general from the Comd CA staff, and a project director from D JCBRN D staff. The ADM(Mat) provides the project management function and has responsibility for the acquisition, distribution and support of CBRND equipment. Three directorates within DGLEPM support CBRND material acquisition and sustainment activities: Director Combat Support Equipment Management, Director Soldier Systems Program Management and Director Land Command Systems Program Management. The staffs of these directorates also respond to the D JCBRN D capability manager for sustainment of in-service equipment. The Comd CA monitors project implementation activities to ensure that deliverables comply with the statement of operational requirements. To help achieve this Comd CA has developed and issued a functional directive entitled _Chief of Army Staff Functional Directive for Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Sensor Integration Standards_. DGLEPM is the project leader for implementation and is responsible, through normal reporting channels, to the Deputy Minister and to the CFD for all aspects of project implementation. The project leader for implementation chairs the Senior Review Board.

**7.4** Joint, special operations and ECS planning staffs must identify potential future requirements for CBRND in strategic planning guidance.

**7.5** CBRN med CMs are the responsibility of the Surg Gen who, in cooperation with the D JCBRN D, coordinates CBRN med CM requirements in the development of CBRND capability.

**Role of DGCSI**

**7.6** The role of the DGCSI is both to provide strategic decision support and to act as a challenge function with respect to capability and force structure requirements. This means that the DGCSI analyzes files, project documentation, strategic initiatives, and new capabilities and force structures being proposed or delivered, to ensure that they are aligned with strategic need and direction as articulated by the DND and the CAF. The D JCBRN D contributes to the DGCSI process in regards to all aspects of CBRND, predominantly in cooperation with its following two directorates:

1.  the Director Capability Integration, who is responsible for:  
    i. providing capability requirements analysis using the tools and results of capability-based  
    planning;  
    ii. leading the maintenance of FSE document, the development of the force development scenarios,  
    the production of the _Capability-Based Planning Report_ and the promulgation of the FCG; and  
    iii. providing capability requirement tailored analysis on projects and initiatives to the CFD and the  
    Vice Chief of the Defence Staff ensuring that analyses are aligned with strategic need and  
    directions when submitted to the DCB and program management boards; and
2.  the Director Structure Integration, who is responsible for:  
    i. conducting the force structure requirements analysis for projects, programs and other major  
    initiatives within the CAF, in collaboration with force development partners and informed by the  
    FCG;  
    ii. providing advice regarding proposed structural changes;  
    iii. employing comprehensive decision support risk analysis modeling to ensure a balanced,  
    responsible approach to proposed structural changes; and  
    iv. undertaking major studies and reviews, assisting in implementation planning and providing  
    recommendations to senior leadership based on strategic guidance, executive level direction and  
    GC initiatives including the _Multi-Year Establishment Plan_.

**Service Level Agreements**

**7.7** The implementation of CBRND concepts, doctrine and individual and collective specialist training is achieved through SLAs between the D JCBRN D and the designated MES authorities assigned under DAOD 5070-0. SLAs:

1.  outline roles, responsibilities and procedures for a training support strategy for the fielding of capabilities by the CBRND capability development program throughout the life cycles of the equipment fielded;
2.  define the working relationship between the MES authorities for CBRND specialty implementation, the D JCBRN D and the strategic level agency responsible for coordinating the CBRND capabilities; and
3.  identify the D JCBRN D as the primary POC and coordinating office concerning CBRND job performance requirements and CBRND-related strategic level guidance.

**R&D Program Overview**

**7.8** DRDC undertakes R&D in support of the CBRND capability development program. The program consists of short-term and long-term activities relating to technologies and defence applications relevant to optimizing human performance in a CBRN environment. To optimize the use of DRDC resources, the R&D goals are achieved by various means. The research may be conducted:

1.  internally by defence scientists;
2.  externally by experts in the private sector and academia under contract; and
3.  collaboratively with national partners and international allies, to leverage expertise and resources.

**S&T Program Formulation**

**7.9** The R&D effort and the scientific support related to CBRND are managed by the CEO DRDC and are quantified in the CBRND S&T programs and projects within the force employment portfolio. The programs and projects are developed as set out in the following table:

| Stage | Who does it? | Action |

**NATO North Atlantic Council 225, JCBRND-CDG Interoperability**

**7.13** Interoperability with NATO forces is achieved through the implementation of STANAGs and the promulgation of allied publications. The NATO North Atlantic Council 225, JCBRND-CDG, develops CBRND-related STANAGs dealing with:

1.  operational and technical doctrine;
2.  equipment and material testing protocols; and
3.  equipment and materiel specifications.

**Responsibilities of the JCBRND-CDG**

**7.14** The D JCBRN D is responsible for acting as the head of the Canadian delegation to the JCBRND-CDG meetings and, as the Canadian POC, for addressing issues arising from such meetings. The D JCBRN D is responsible for participating in the JCBRND-CDG panels while the CEO DRDC is responsible for coordinating or providing scientific expertise representation as required. The subject matter of the different JCBRND-CDG panels is organized as follows:

1.  detection, identification and monitoring;
2.  doctrine and terminology;
3.  information management;
4.  hazard management;
5.  physical protection; and

1.  the D JCBRN D is responsible for providing DND and CAF assistance and advice; and
2.  the CEO DRDC is responsible for providing scientific assistance and advice.

**Equipment Hardening for CBRN Attack**

**7.20** Canada has adopted numerous STANAGs relating to the design and capabilities of CBRND systems that commit the CAF to adopt the NATO-approved acceptance criteria, design guidelines, test procedures and analytical procedures for designing military equipment. Details are outlined in a series of AEPs (see section 10, _Other References_). These STANAGs are followed during the design, testing and acceptance of military equipment.

**Equipment Design and Hardening**

**7.21** When designing CAF equipment, PMs must ensure providing equipment with the capability to withstand the effects of a CBRN attack and allowing for ease of equipment decontamination. PMs must further ensure, when designing platforms and equipment that, if they are contaminated, the platforms and equipment can be operated by crews dressed in full individual protective equipment, with only the minimum surface to be decontaminated (typically operational-level decontamination) in order to continue the mission. All new and refurbished mission-essential land, sea and air platforms and equipment which are at risk of becoming affected during a CBRN incident must also be considered by PMs for hardening in order to enhance their survivability.

**CARC System Application**

**7.22** When paint would normally be applied, a CARC system meeting STANAG 4360, _Specification for Paint Systems, Resistant to Chemical Agents and Decontaminants, for the Protection of Land Military Equipment_ (classified document), must be considered as the finish on all vehicles (including vehicle interiors), weapon systems, ships, aircraft maintenance support equipment and other major components procured for military operations. These coatings should be applied to all equipment intended for deployed operations when refinishing is required. Chemical agent resistance is not required of any temporary, removable coating (e.g. powder paints) applied over a CARC if the removable coating can be easily removed without damaging the underlying CARC. An ADM(Mat) Paint LCMM can identify other suitable coatings or surface treatments having high chemical agent resistance if it is determined that the CARC system selected for the main equipment interferes with the:

1.  operation of equipment accessories being coated (e.g. communications antennas or radomes);
2.  radar or infrared signatures of aircraft; or
3.  requirement to protect a substrate (e.g. aluminum or composites) from degeneration.

**Waivers of CBRN Hardening Policy**

**7.23** A request to waive any requirements of the CBRN hardening policy must be submitted by the PM to the Comd CA for approval.

**Life Cycle Materiel Management – Introducing Capabilities**

**7.24** Under the provisions of the _Defence Planning and Management Framework_, the D JCBRN D directs joint CBRND projects and introduces capabilities through the capital program of the Defence Services Programme using its major capital equipment and minor project mechanisms. The DGLEPM provides project management support to these projects. Any CBRND equipment procured outside the scope of the D JCBRN D and ADM(Mat) program is not supported as Common Equipment National Procurement, and may cause some confusion for DND and CAF CBRND equipment holders. While it is recognized that each of the commands may have unique requirements, the D JCBRN D must be consulted concerning CBRND equipment procured outside of the terms of the CAF joint CBRND program.

**Joint Requirements Synergies**

**7.25** When an agreement refers to radiological or nuclear standards or requirements, D N Safe collaboration is required. As per NSODs, measurement of doses and exposure to ionizing radiation is only conducted with equipment approved for use by D N Safe. Accordingly, D N Safe must be consulted before any such equipment is procured.

**Sustainability and Maintainability Problems**

**7.26** Sustainability and maintainability problems with in-service capabilities identified by ADM(Mat) LCMMs are communicated, along with modifications that are required or have been implemented, to the D JCBRN D who is responsible to ensure that any resulting amendments to doctrine, procedures and training are promulgated throughout the CAF.

**Joint CBRND Equipment**

**7.27** ADM(Mat) LCMMs must report the status of operational and logistic stocks of joint CBRND equipment to the D JCBRN D.

**Removing Obsolete or Non-Supportable Capabilities**

**7.28** Any ADM(Mat) LCMM who identifies obsolete CBRND equipment, or sustainability or maintainability problems with in-service capabilities, must inform the D JCBRN D of such equipment or problems. The D JCBRN D, in cooperation with the applicable ECS, is responsible for overseeing the removal of obsolete or non-supportable capabilities.

8\. Consequences
