4\. Policy Direction
--------------------

**Context**

**4.1** Defence intelligence:

1.  plays a crucial role in meeting the core responsibilities of the DND, including research and development, capability development and defence procurement, and enables the success of CAF operations; and
2.  is also a critical component of the ability of GC to make informed policy, partnership and program decisions in matters concerning national defence, national security and foreign affairs.

**4.2** The legal authority to conduct defence activities, including any defence intelligence activity, is provided by the _National Defence Act_ and other Canadian legislation, international laws and elements of common law, including the Crown prerogative. All means and methods used in the conduct of a defence intelligence activity remain subject to these laws and must also comply with GC, ministerial, DND and CAF policies and directives. To conduct a defence intelligence activity, there must be a clear nexus between the nature and scope of the activity and the mandate of the DND and the CAF. The DND and the CAF also ensure that all defence intelligence programs, administration and activities take into account broader GC strategic priorities and interests. If intelligence activities are conducted in response to a lawful request from an external stakeholder, the support must comply with the mandate and authorities that govern the requesting body.

**4.3** The administration of defence intelligence remains challenging due to its complexity and sensitivity, as well as the fact that defence intelligence expertise and resources are widely dispersed across DND organizations and CAF commands. As a result, to ensure the continued responsiveness, effectiveness and accountability for defence intelligence, the following policies provide high-level direction regarding its conduct:

1.  the _Ministerial Directive on Defence Intelligence_, which provides direction to the DM and the CDS with respect to their respective accountabilities and responsibilities for defence intelligence, as well as the authorities of the CDI and the Comd CFINTCOM; and
2.  the _Ministerial Directive on Defence Intelligence Priorities_, which provides direction to the DM and the CDS regarding priorities for the collection, analysis and production of defence intelligence by the DND and the CAF.

**4.4** In accordance with the _Ministerial Directive on Defence Intelligence_ and the _Ministerial Directive on Defence Intelligence Priorities_, the DND and the CAF may develop, generate and employ such defence intelligence capabilities as are required to enable lawful, timely and effective decisions and actions in support of:

1.  DND core responsibilities, including research and development, capability development and defence procurement, and the CAF capability development and force generation activities;
2.  the core roles and mission of the CAF, including the planning and execution of routine and contingency operations carried out in the defence of Canada, the defence of North America in cooperation with the United States and the promotion of international peace and security; and
3.  lawful requests for intelligence support from external stakeholders.

**4.5** In supporting the activities mentioned in paragraph 4.4, DND and CAF defence intelligence capabilities may also be developed, generated and employed to contribute to the security of DND employees and CAF members, infrastructure, materiel, information and systems. Defence intelligence may also assist senior DND, CAF and GC decision-makers in achieving ongoing situational awareness of defence intelligence priority issues and in having strategic warning of impending crises in support of policy development regarding national defence, national security and foreign affairs objectives.

**4.6** The ministerial directives referred to in paragraph 4.3 establish that the CDI exercises functional authority for defence intelligence and is directly accountable to the DM and CDS in that capacity for issuing direction and guidance, and providing oversight of all defence intelligence across the DND and the CAF, including deployed operations. The functional authority exercised by the CDI over DND organizations and CAF commands in respect of defence intelligence resources and responsibilities never overrides nor supplants direction from the DM or orders from the CDS, which flow downwards through channels of communication and the chain of command respectively. The Comd CFINTCOM is directly and solely accountable to the CDS for the effective leadership and administration of the CFINTCOM.

**Policy Statement**

**4.7** The DND and the CAF are committed to maintaining the maximum possible responsiveness and effectiveness for defence intelligence programs, administration and activities across the DND and the CAF, including deployed operations, while ensuring that these programs, administration and activities are carried out in an accountable manner.

**Requirements**

**4.8** The DND and the CAF must ensure that the following take place:

1.  appropriate subordinate direction and guidance is developed, issued and implemented in respect of defence intelligence programs, administration and activities, including in relation to emerging technologies, the use of social media and biometrics;
2.  structures are established to provide a process for the continual monitoring and assessment of defence intelligence programs, administration and activities across DND organizations and CAF commands to determine if they are being performed or occurring as intended, and producing desired results in compliance with all applicable laws, policies and directives, including provision in the structures for the support of review mechanisms that may be developed for any defence intelligence;
3.  the DM and the CDS remain properly informed of defence intelligence activities and of any new international defence intelligence arrangements that are made, as well as any substantial modifications to the nature or scope of any existing arrangements;
4.  interdepartmental and legal consultations are undertaken, as required, before any defence intelligence activity is carried out, and approved by the DM, the CDS or both, that is:
    1.  considered to be particularly sensitive; or
    2.  likely to present a significant impact on any of the areas outlined in paragraph 18 of the _Ministerial Directive on Defence Intelligence_;
5.  interdepartmental consultation is carried out as required before entering into any intelligence-related arrangements with a foreign government, private or public organization or multilateral body;
6.  every aspect of defence intelligence complies with all applicable Canadian and international laws, as well as GC, ministerial, DND and CAF policies and directives;
7.  an annual report on defence intelligence, approved by the DM and the CDS, is provided to the Minister of National Defence; and
8.  DND employees and CAF members fully comply with requests for information as required to complete annual reports on defence intelligence for DND and CAF leadership.

**4.9** The Comds of the RCN, CA, RCAF, CJOC and CANSOFCOM, and the Deputy Comd NORAD, must assign a defence intelligence advisor within their organizations to be responsible for the application of CDI direction with regard to oversight and verification of their defence intelligence activities. These advisors must be responsive to the CDI direction.

5\. Consequences
----------------

**General**

**5.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
