2\. Definitions
---------------

**CF diver** (_plongeur militaire_)

CF diver means a diver qualified in any sub-category of CF diving, whether a member of a CF diving team or a CAF member who is maintaining currency and qualification through casual diving with a CF diving team.

**CF diving** (_plongée militaire_)

CF diving means diving using underwater breathing apparatus, as well as the use by CF divers of hyperbaric chambers and other forms of underwater intervention, including remotely underwater operated vehicles, submersibles and related special sensors.

**CF diving team** (_équipe de plongeurs militaires_)

CF diving team means an organizational sub-unit identified in command orders that is authorized to conduct CF diving, meets the standards set out in the _Canadian Forces Diving Manual_, and is recognized by D Dive S.

3\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**3.1** This DAOD provides policy applicable to all units, formations and headquarters having responsibilities pertaining to CF diving (i.e. CF diving authorities), all CAF members engaged in CF diving, as well as all DND employees and CAF members carrying out duties relating to any aspect of CF diving.

**3.2** CF diving is performed by units of the maritime, land and air environmental commands (ECs), the Experimental Diving and Undersea Group (EDU Grp) and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet a wide variety of operational commitments. While the separate roles of the ECs, the EDU Grp and the Dwyer Hill Training Center (DHTC) determine the differing tasks of each CF diving team, many aspects of CF diving are standardized:

1.  application of CAF diving orders and instructions;
2.  conduct of CAF diving operations;
3.  standards and conduct of CAF diving training;
4.  standards for periodic inspections;
5.  conduct of operational evaluations;
6.  statements of requirements;
7.  CAF diving equipment maintenance;
8.  CAF diving equipment procurement;
9.  application of medical standards; and
10.  action upon occurrence of CAF diving accidents.

**3.3** For the purposes of this DAOD, the following activities are not functions of CF diving:

1.  CAF recreational SCUBA Club diving;
2.  CAF swimming;
3.  water sports; and
4.  military rescue swimming, such as from Her Majesty's Canadian Ships.

### Policy Statement

**3.4** The DND and the CAF are committed to ensure that CF diving, whether operational or training, shall be performed:

1.  only by qualified CF divers or, in the case of training, eligible CF diver candidates;
2.  using diving equipment approved by the CAF;
3.  in accordance with CAF diving safety and medical standards; and
4.  in accordance with CAF orders and instructions governing the conduct of CF diving.

**3.5** The CF Diving Policy Committee (CFDPC) is the primary organization for the development of CF diving policy. The CFDPC is chaired by D Dive S with representatives from all ECs. The CFDPC normally meets annually.

**3.6** All diving at the EDU Grp shall be conducted in accordance with this policy, except as authorized in DAOD 8009-1, _Canadian Forces Diving - Organization and Operating Principles and_ DAOD 5061-0, _Research Involving Human Subjects_ and DAOD 5061-1, _Research Involving Human Subject - Approval Procedures._

### Requirements

**3.7** CAF diving authorities shall:

1.  maintain a standard of CAF diving qualifications, based on EC requirements;
2.  ensure all CF divers, as well as all DND employees and CAF members carrying out duties relating to any aspect of CF diving, comply with orders promulgated in the _Canadian Forces Diving Manual_ governing the conduct of CAF diving operations and training;
3.  ensure that CAF diving equipment is tested, repaired and maintained in accordance with established standards and applicable _Canadian Forces Technical Orders_ (CFTOs);
4.  ensure compliance with _CF Diving General Memoranda_ (DGM) containing safety information to all CAF diving authorities and CF diving teams; and
5.  ensure up to date records of all CAF diving activities are maintained in accordance with applicable orders and instructions.
