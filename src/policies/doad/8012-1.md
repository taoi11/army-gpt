1\. Introduction
----------------

**Date of Issue:** 2011-08-04

**Date of Last Modification:** 2022-09-28

**Application:** This DAOD is a directive that applies to employees of the Department of National Defence (DND employees) and an order that applies to officers and non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF members).

**Approval Authority:** Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI)

**Enquiries:** Director Meteorological and Oceanography (D Met Oc)

2\. Overview
------------

### Organization

**2.1** The Canadian Forces Weather and Oceanographic Service (CFWOS) provides and arranges for the provision of meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) data, products and services to fulfil DND and CAF requirements anywhere in or outside Canada.

**2.2** Strategic level oversight of the METOC Data, Products and Services Programme is provided by the CFWOS Steering Committee established by the CDI.

**2.3** Members of the Steering Committee include director-level representatives of:

1.  all commands with METOC resources;
2.  Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC); and
3.  Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO).

**2.4** The _Canadian Forces Weather and Oceanographic Service Manual_ sets out the terms of reference for the Steering Committee.

### METOC Data, Products and Services In and Outside Canada

**2.5** The DND and the CAF must make use of the METOC data, products and services of:

1.  ECCC and DFO for operations and training in Canada; and
2.  a METOC designated host or lead nation in an international coalition, for operations and training outside Canada.

**2.6** If the METOC data, products and services available for use from the sources set out in paragraph 2.5 are not adequate to ensure safety and operational effectiveness, additional support is provided through the CFWOS.

3\. Management of the Meteorological and Oceanographic Data, Products and Services Programme
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Oversight and Coordination

**3.1** To assist in the oversight, review and coordination of the METOC Data, Products and Services Programme, D Met Oc has established the CFWOS Management Committee (MC), comprised of representatives from all commands with METOC resources.

**3.2** D Met Oc hosts the annual military oceanography (MILOC) meeting to provide oversight, review and coordination for the MILOC programme and the underwater acoustics programme.

**3.3** Ad hoc or permanent working groups may be formed to support the CFWOS MC and the annual MILOC meeting as required.

**3.4** The _Canadian Forces Weather and Oceanographic Service Manual_ sets out the terms of reference for the MC and the MILOC members. This manual and the _Canadian Forces Military Oceanography Manual_ provide detailed direction and guidance. Both manuals are available on the Directorate of Meteorology and Oceanography intranet site.

### Reviews

**3.5** Reviews may be undertaken by the CFWOS MC as required and during the annual MILOC meeting as a result of:

1.  changes in METOC user requirements in the DND and the CAF;
2.  advances in scientific knowledge;
3.  improvements or modifications in METOC equipment; or
4.  changes in funding allocations.

**3.6** Any CFWOS MC or MILOC representative may initiate a review.

4\. Compliance and Consequences
-------------------------------

### Compliance

**4.1** DND employees and CAF members must comply with this DAOD. Should clarification of the policies or instructions set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. Managers and military leaders have the primary responsibility for and means of ensuring the compliance of their DND employees and CAF members with this DAOD.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**4.2** DND employees and CAF members are accountable to their respective managers and military leaders for any failure to comply with the direction set out in this DAOD. Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance may be investigated. Managers and military leaders must take or direct appropriate corrective measures if non-compliance with this DAOD has consequences for the DND or the CAF. The decision of an L1 or other senior official to take action or to intervene in a case of non-compliance, other than in respect of a decision under the Code of Service Discipline regarding a CAF member, will depend on the degree of risk based on the impact and likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from the non-compliance and other circumstances of the case.

**Note –** In respect of the compliance of DND employees, see the Treasury Board _Framework for the Management of Compliance_ for additional information.
