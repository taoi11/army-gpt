**Supersession:** NDHQ Instruction ADM(Mat) 4/89, _DND Policy – Animal Use in Research and Development_

**Approval Authority:** Assistant Deputy Minister (Science and Technology) (ADM(S&T))

**Enquiries:** Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC)

2\. Definition
--------------

**animal care committee** (_comité de protection des animaux_)

A committee that is constituted and governed according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) policy statement: _Terms of Reference for Animal Care Committees_. (Defence Terminology Bank record number 48226)

3\. Administration
------------------

### Context

**3.1** For contextual information in respect of animal use in research, teaching and testing, see section 3 of DAOD 8014-0, _Animal Use in Research, Teaching and Testing_.

### General

**3.2** Heads of DND organizations and commanding officers of CAF units that use animals in research, teaching or testing activities are responsible for ensuring that:

1.  the animals are only used when the best efforts of the researcher to find a suitable alternative have failed;
2.  the most humane methods of research, teaching or testing are employed on the smallest number of appropriate animals required to obtain valid information;
3.  an animal care committee (ACC) is established and maintained, or the services of an ACC of another DND organization or CAF unit, such as a DRDC centre, are used;
4.  written animal use protocols for the research, teaching or testing and standard operating procedures to facilitate the work of protocol authors and ACC members, are developed;
5.  animal use protocols are regularly reviewed to reduce, refine and replace animals whenever possible; and
6.  their facilities are open for inspection by an assessment panel of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC).

**3.3** When an external agency is contracted by or collaborates with the DND and the CAF to conduct such research, teaching or testing activities, a separate agreement is drafted to ensure the agency complies with the applicable provisions of the DAOD 8014 series (see paragraph 3.5 of this DAOD).

### Conditions for the Use of Animals

**3.4** The DND and the CAF may use animals in research, teaching and testing only if such use promises to contribute to the:

1.  understanding of environmental principles or issues;
2.  understanding of fundamental biological principles;
3.  development of knowledge that can reasonably be expected to benefit humans, animals or the environment; or
4.  education of DND employees, CAF members and other trainees undergoing occupation training.

**Note –** See the CCAC Web site for more information.

### Use of Animals Under Contractual Agreements

**3.5** DND employees or CAF members responsible for arranging contracts under which animals are to be used for research, teaching and testing must ensure that the work:

1.  is done under the guidance and oversight of an ACC;
2.  strictly complies with all policies and guidelines of the CCAC; and
3.  is performed at an institution that holds a CCAC Certificate of GAP – Good Animal Practice®.

**3.6** If the contracted work is performed outside of Canada, the contract authority must ensure that the work is done in a facility and under animal use protocols that meet or exceed the standards set out in the policies and guidelines of the CCAC.

### CCAC Representative

**3.7** DRDC provides a representative to be a member of the CCAC if:

1.  any research, teaching or testing activities involving the use of animals are carried out by the DND or the CAF; and
2.  the CCAC requests a representative from DRDC.

4\. Consequences
----------------

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**4.1** Non-compliance with this DAOD may have consequences for both the DND and the CAF as institutions, and for DND employees and CAF members as individuals. Suspected non-compliance will be investigated. The nature and severity of the consequences resulting from actual non-compliance will be commensurate with the circumstances of the non-compliance.
