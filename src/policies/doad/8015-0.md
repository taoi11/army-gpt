4\. Policy Direction
--------------------

### Context

**4.1** The CAF must develop and maintain pan-domain capabilities to deliver forces capable of operating seamlessly in complex operations. Regardless of the challenges the CAF face, joint readiness activities must focus and build towards the capacity and capabilities of the CAF to execute operations set out in Canada’s defence policy.

**4.2** The _CDS Directive for CAF Force Posture and Readiness_ (the _CAF FP&R Directive_) provides strategic military direction to the force generators to deliver specific operational outputs that are linked to the roles assigned to the CAF by the Government of Canada. It is the principal document by which the CDS issues FG direction. Based on the _CAF FP&R Directive_, force generators may develop MRPs, comprised of training activities, both L1-centric and joint (including CT), that are planned, managed and coordinated to generate and prepare forces for operations. Detailed and accurate readiness reporting will inform key decisions and ensure that CAF core outputs are accurately represented.

**4.3** CJOC as the CAF JRA is directly responsible to the CDS to synchronize CAF joint readiness activities with all L1 advisors through the following governance bodies:

1.  the Joint Readiness Working Group;
2.  the Joint Readiness Steering Committee; and
3.  the Joint Readiness Management Board.

**4.4** Under the JMRP, these governance bodies ensure that all joint readiness activities are consistent with defence policy and the requirements for high readiness FElms defined in the _CAF FP&R Directive_.

**4.5** The _JMRP Volume 1, Standing Guidance on the Management of Joint Readiness in the CAF_, and the _JMRP Volume 2, Annual Direction on the Conduct of Joint Readiness in the CAF_, are issued by the Comd CJOC as the JRA, and supplement the MRPs of the force generators, in order to enhance joint operational readiness to meet CAF missions. These two volumes reflect the policy and direction to generate ready joint forces, provide enduring guidance for the conduct of joint readiness in the CAF, and list near-term joint readiness events. The JMRP is resourced through the JETA, a corporate fund that enables the conduct of CAF joint readiness in the pan-domain environment in order to develop and maintain the joint readiness required to meet mandated CAF operational capabilities.

**4.6** The key output of the JMRP is the SXTP, which prioritizes joint readiness activities for resourcing. The SXTP is based on an analysis of strategic priorities, linked to operational and contingency plans required to be exercised, and integrates a mix of applicable pan-domain capabilities.

### Policy Statement

**4.7** The CAF is committed to conducting joint training as the fundamental method of providing CAF members, operational units and formations with the experience, confidence and training necessary to carry out their assigned missions.

### Requirements

**4.8** The CAF must:

1.  force generate and maintain FElms in accordance with the _CAF FP&R Directive_;
2.  structure joint training to enhance pan-domain capabilities identified by the CDS and force employers;
3.  ensure compliance with joint readiness governance framework and the direction for CAF readiness activities provided in the _CAF FP&R Directive_ and the JMRP, including resourcing; and
4.  develop annual budgets for joint and CT.

5\. Consequences
----------------

### **General**

**5.1** Should clarification of the policy statement, requirements, or authorities set out in this DAOD be required, DND employees and CAF members may seek direction through their channel of communication or chain of command, as appropriate. The anticipated results set out in the policy statement may not be achieved by the DND and the CAF if the requirements specified in this DAOD are not properly implemented. Not achieving the anticipated results could affect the ability of the DND and the CAF to ensure that the CAF is prepared to undertake missions for the defence of Canada and Canadians, security in North America and the maintenance of international peace and stability.
